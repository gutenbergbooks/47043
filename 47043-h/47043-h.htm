<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>My object in writing this little book has been to collect
together in a popular and readable form the main facts
connected with the question of destitute immigration.
I have endeavoured to set forth as concisely as possible
the evils consequent upon our present system, and to place
before the public the leading arguments in favour of
some moderate and judicious restriction of the influx of
the destitute and worthless of other countries. In doing so,
I have studiously avoided identifying this important question
with any particular party, or any particular creed. It is a
matter which concerns the nation as a whole, and it is one
in which men of all creeds and parties&mdash;Jew or Christian,
Liberal or Conservative&mdash;may unite together for good. The
advisability of restricting our present system of unchecked
destitute immigration is a matter upon which there exists
considerable difference of opinion. In giving expression
to my earnest convictions, I ask for that same indulgence
which I willingly extend to those who may differ from
my conclusions.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY_NOTE" id="INTRODUCTORY_NOTE">INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</a></h2>


<p>I have been asked to write a short preface to a work
in which the author proposes to afford the public information
with respect to the immigration of destitute
aliens into this country. He will discuss the evil incident
to an immigration that is practically uncontrolled; and he
will suggest the lines in which, in his opinion, remedial
legislation should be promoted.</p>

<p>The subject is one of very great importance, and I am
confident it will be approached by the writer in a dispassionate
spirit. He must know that he will fail of his
object unless it is perfectly clear he is not influenced by
any prejudice against the race to which the greater part of
the destitute immigrants are known to belong. He will
make it abundantly clear there is no desire or intention to
forbid the man who is persecuted, either for his religious
creed or his political opinions, from finding an asylum
among us.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of many who have given to this subject
much consideration, that the destitute foreigners who come
to England in such numbers exchange into a condition
that is hardly less tolerable, than that from which they have
fled in the lands of their birth. It is said they exercise an
influence that is morally and socially to the hurt of those
among whom they come to dwell. It is contended that
they injuriously compete with our own people in the labour
market. It is often urged that they compel our people to
seek a home and employment in other lands, because of
the glut they cause in the labour market, and because of
their readiness to accept wages and to be content with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
conditions of living which are unacceptable, and something
more than merely unacceptable, to the Englishman.</p>

<p>These allegations require to be investigated. It is important
to ascertain what the number of foreign immigrants
really is, and what is their condition when they land among
us. It is desirable we should know what provision is made,
if any, for their reception, and what becomes of the men,
women, and children, who are said to arrive in London in
large numbers, and for the most part absolutely destitute. Is
overcrowding, with its consequent miseries and ills, appreciably
increased in the East End of London? These are
questions on which the public ought to be informed, and
the guardians of the health, and morals, and general well-being
of the people must desire to be enlightened on these
matters. If the evils that are said to be the results of the
immigration of destitute aliens are found to exist, it will be
for our legislators to devise in their wisdom the appropriate
remedy. I will only venture to express one opinion with
reference to this difficult and intricate subject.</p>

<p>I am of opinion it is not safe to allow things to remain
as they are without thorough investigation. On the part of
the immigrants there is a widespread feeling that they are
the victims of unjust aspersions; on the part of the native
population there is a disquieting feeling that the authorities
are indifferent to their interests, and careless of their
sufferings. The antipathy of race to race is consequently
and injuriously fomented. It is not to the good of the
whole community that this state of things should be allowed
to continue. If this book shall help to throw light upon the
matters in dispute, and influence public opinion to move
the authorities to investigation, and, if the evils said to
follow upon unrestricted immigration are found to exist, to
endeavour to remove them by legislation&mdash;it will not have
been written in vain.</p>

<br />THE GENERAL ASPECT.</h2>


<p>The unrestricted influx of destitute aliens into the United
Kingdom is a matter which has for some time past attracted
a considerable amount of public attention. Within the last
few years a Select Committee of the House of Commons
has inquired into this question, and has published a report
acknowledging its extent and recognizing some of its evils.
The Sweating Committee of the House of Lords has dealt
with it indirectly, so far as it concerned the subject in hand.
Trades Unions and Labour Congresses have passed resolutions
condemning, in a more or less general way, the present
system of unchecked and unsifted immigration. But it is
only quite recently that it has advanced to a place within
the realm of practical politics. Few public questions have
ripened so quickly as this has done. Last year<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it was
discussed, it is true, but only in an academic way, as one
of those matters which loom among "the dim and distant
visions of the future." To-day it is emphatically one of the
questions of the hour. The Electorate is considering it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the Press&mdash;that sure reflex of public opinion&mdash;is discussing
it, and the leaders of political parties, forced by the growing
pressure from beneath, are making up their minds about it.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are not very far to seek. Two great
causes have tended to bring this question to the front at the
present time. One, the recent edicts promulgated by the
Czar against his Jewish subjects in Russia, edicts with which
no right-thinking man can have any possible sympathy, and
which necessarily have the result of driving many thousands
of Russian Jews to seek their fortunes anew in other lands;
the other, the action this year<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the United States Government,
in passing a law which has had the effect of practically
closing the Atlantic ports to the poorer class of aliens altogether.
Now since the inevitable tendency in the movement
of peoples is from East to West, and since Great
Britain, after America, is admittedly the country to which
the greatest portion of these Eastern immigrants come, it
follows, as a matter of course, that the action of the American
Government in thus shutting their doors to the refuse population
of the Old World, cannot fail to have the effect of
greatly intensifying the evil here. Our little overcrowded
island is really the only place left for them to come&mdash;the
only country among all the nations of Europe, with one
insignificant exception, which has not seen fit to protect its
own people against the influx of the destitute and unfit of
other lands. These are the two principal causes which have
forced this question to the front. There is another also
which will prevent its ever again sinking into the background.
It is this. The working-classes of this country, with whom
rests the balance of political power, have taken the matter
up, and, having once taken it up, they will not let it drop.
On this I shall dwell more fully later on. I merely allude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to it now, as one of the factors which will have to be considered
in dealing with this problem.</p>

<p>In taking a general survey of the situation, the first thing
that strikes one is the isolated action of England in this
matter, when compared with other nations. It may be laid
down as an axiom admitting of no cavil, that it is the duty
of every State to deal with its own paupers and undesirable
citizens; and moreover it is obvious that this desirable
state of affairs can only be brought about by other countries
refusing to admit them. This common-sense view has been
adopted by all other European countries, except Portugal,
which has practically no immigration at all, and can scarcely,
therefore, be said to count; by all our principal colonies,
notably, Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Canada;
by the great Republic of the United States, and in a general
sense by nearly every civilized nation throughout the world.
Those of our colonies which have not prohibitory statutes,
have the power, and use it too, of passing restraining laws
from time to time as need requires, which effectually meet
the purpose for which they are enacted. All through Europe
there are either laws prohibiting the admission of undesirable
aliens, or the police regulations and local customs render
their continued residence impossible. Even the well-to-do
Englishman who goes abroad, for no other purpose than to
spend his money, finds himself compelled, should he remain
in one place for any length of time, to contribute, in all sorts
of ways, to the taxes of the country in which he resides.
Rightly so too, since he enjoys the benefit of the protection
which the State affords to him. In particular instances
this rule may seem to press hardly on individuals, since in
Germany, for instance, even an Englishwoman who gives a
few lessons in her native tongue is compelled to pay a tax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
upon her earnings, a tax in some cases so large as to make
the pittance she obtains hardly worth the earning. Yet
those aliens who are sent to us from other countries&mdash;I
speak now of the destitute and unfit&mdash;contribute nothing to
our taxes, nothing to our national welfare, nothing to our
national defence; they take everything and give nothing in
return, even worse than nothing, since their habits and their
customs exercise a most injurious effect upon the English
community with whom they come in contact.</p>

<p>What then can be urged against England following the
example of other countries in this matter? Nothing but a
mere sentiment that she is a country free and open to all,
and that all who will should find a refuge upon her hospitable
shores. This is a sentiment worthy of all honour, but
hospitality may be carried too far, and in this instance it is
not a question of its exercise, but of its abuse. There is a
homely maxim that "Charity begins at home," and if this
be true of individuals it is no less true of nations. The
first duty of the father of a household is towards his own
family. He must not give bread to others while his own
children are starving. He must not give shelter to the
stranger, and drive his sons and daughters out into the cold.
In the same way, the first duty of a nation is to its own
kith and kin. It must not open its arms to the surplus
population of other lands, while its own people are clamouring
in vain for work. Yet this is the case, and while every
day destitute aliens are pouring in, Englishmen are driven
from the land of their birth to make room for them.
Speaking last year at Liverpool, upon the subject of our
rapidly-increasing population, Lord Derby is reported to
have said that "Emigration is the only palliative." On all
subjects connected with population Lord Derby is a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
authority; but of what avail, I would ask him, is it to
recommend emigration as a panacea for our social ills, when
for every hundred of our people taken away, a leak remains
behind by which thousands more of an immeasurably
inferior calibre come pouring in, by whom the conditions of
existence are made harder than before, and the standard of
comfort and decency in the home-life of our people is
infinitely lowered? As illustrative of this it may be
mentioned that at Leeds, where there is a very large and
increasing foreign colony, some £500 was spent in 1887 in
emigrating English children to Canada; and evidence was
given before the Sweating Committee to the effect that one
day a party of 500 emigrants, mostly young men in the full
prime of their health and vigour, sailed out of Tilbury
Docks, and at the same time another vessel, having on board
700 foreigners, came in. Truly, we are an eccentric nation!</p>

<p>It was George Cruikshank who in allegory drew a map of
England with a board on a pole stuck in the centre, and on
it the following notice to Europe, "Rubbish may be shot
here." It was a caricature, and like all caricatures subject
to exaggeration, but it contained within it the germs of a
great truth. But even Cruikshank little dreamed that
these people would ever arrive here at the rate of 40,000
and 50,000 per annum. Had he done so the notice would
rather have run, "No admittance." "Oh," but I hear some
say, "you would check this influx, but what of the people
we emigrate to other countries?" I would answer that there
is no just or fair comparison to be drawn between the people
we send away, chiefly young and able-bodied men, and the
wretched, under-sized, destitute immigrants we gain in
exchange. As things are at present all schemes of emigration
and colonization, however well-meaning, are beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the mark. We are drawing out of the barrel and pouring
in at the top. More than that, we are drawing out good
wine and pouring in bad. It is idle to talk of reprisals,
because, as I have already pointed out, other countries have
taken steps to guard against this evil. No other civilized
nation will take our paupers, our criminals, our lunatics,
our outcasts. Why then, in the name of common sense,
should we be compelled to take theirs?</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to confuse this simple
issue. Many red herrings have been drawn across the track.
It has been said, without one jot or tittle of evidence, that
this demand for some moderate measure of restriction, veils
behind it a desire to check foreign immigration altogether.
Nothing could be farther from the truth. No objection can
be urged against foreign immigration as a whole, but only
that part of it which exercises an injurious effect upon our
own people. There are, for instance, at the present time
many foreigners in England employed in different professions
and vocations, as teachers of languages, clerks,
waiters, cooks, artisans, and so forth. These are in no sense
an evil, for they supply a felt want, and are decent and
cleanly in their habits and mode of living. Many of them
are gradually absorbed into our national life, and become
good and useful members of the community. The skilled
labourer, the decent artisan, the man with brains to work, or
with money to spend, is always welcome to our shores.</p>

<p>Such were the Huguenots. They had not much money,
perhaps, but they brought with them something more
precious than mere wealth,&mdash;the brain, the bone, the muscle,
and the manufacturing talent of France. They introduced into
England arts and manufactures hitherto unknown, and they
added to the lustre of their adopted country by contributing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to the science and the literature of the day. They were in
fact the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fine fleur</i> of the French nation.</p>

<p>A similar influx was that of the Flemings, which took
place at an earlier period of England's history. The Flemings,
who introduced into our country the finer kind of
weaving, first came to England during the reign of Edward
III. The weavers of England were then unable to produce
any of the better kinds of cloth, and the difficulties and
expense of having to send abroad whenever any material
was required superior to the coarse home-made product
were necessarily great. Under these circumstances, it was
obviously a wise policy of the English king to induce the
Flemish weavers to come over to England, and to bring
their looms with them. The high wages offered, and the
prospect held out of ample employment, soon brought large
numbers. A like policy was pursued by several of the other
English kings who reigned during the period which elapsed
between the death of Edward III. and the accession of
Edward VI., and there was from time to time a considerable
influx of skilled artisans of all classes. In the reign of
Edward VI. it appears however that public opinion had
veered round. The influx of Flemings and of foreigners
generally had become so considerable, that there was a
general agreement on the part of the native-born population
that it was no longer necessary to hold out inducements to
foreign craftsmen, since their presence in large numbers
destroyed the demand for good English work, and acted
detrimentally upon the interests of English tradesmen.
Accordingly we find the citizens of London petitioning the
Privy Council to put a stop to this foreign influx, but the
only result appears to have been that an estimate, or census,
was taken of all the foreigners then resident in London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>One must not infer, however, from the case of the Flemings
that the advent of the foreigner was always welcome,
or that the outcry against him in the reign of Edward VI.
was a new thing. The history of the alien in Great Britain
has yet to be written, and space does not permit of its being
dwelt upon to any great extent here. Yet in looking back
upon the legislative enactments of the Plantagenets and
early Tudor kings, which have been briefly referred to elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
one cannot but be struck at the way in which popular
opinion&mdash;of which these acts were doubtless the outcome&mdash;wavered
on this subject. The generous treatment accorded
to the Flemings and other skilled foreign craftsmen who
came to England from time to time contrasts strangely with
the harshness with which foreigners were treated at other
times. In 1155, for instance, there was an anti-foreign outcry,
and many foreigners&mdash;in fact all that could be found&mdash;were
first plundered of their worldly goods, and then banished
from the kingdom. Later on they were allowed to return,
though still compelled to suffer certain disabilities. At one
time the popular prejudice against foreigners was so great
that their lives and property were always in danger, and they
suffered much unfair treatment. The wise policy of Edward
III. removed many of these disabilities, and a special Act
was passed in the reign of Richard II. by which they were
relieved still more. These Acts were those rather of the
king and the upper classes than of the common people,
among whom the animus against the foreigner was still so
strong that that bulwark of English liberty, trial by jury, was
to the alien of no avail, since any charge brought against
him, whether true or false, almost invariably resulted in his
conviction by a British jury. To do away with this injustice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the Enactment of 1430 was passed, which provided that an
alien, if he so wished, might be tried by a mixed jury, of
whom half were to be Englishmen and the other half
foreigners. This singular Statute remained in force until
1870, when the Naturalization Act of that year abolished
the privilege of the alien to claim a mixed jury. This Act
also repealed all previous Acts except the now well-known
Act of 6 &amp; 7 William IV. cap. II., which provides for the
registration of aliens, and to which further allusion will be
made later on.</p>

<p>Harsh and unnecessary as some of the enactments which
were directed against aliens during the reigns of the Plantagenet
kings appear to us now, we may congratulate ourselves
on the fact that even in the reigns of the Plantagenet kings our
Statute Book was never disgraced by such an unjust measure
as the French <cite>Droit d'Aubaine</cite>, which confiscated to the
Crown the whole of the property of an alien, thus leaving
him destitute in a foreign country. This Statute was repealed
in 1791. It was revived by the Code Napoleon, but only
for a brief space, and was finally abolished the year after
Napoleon's downfall at Waterloo. The <cite>Droit d'Aubaine</cite>
was of considerable antiquity, having been doubtless modelled
on the alien laws of ancient Athens, under which similar
confiscations of the property of an alien took place, though,
in spite of the severity of their laws, the Athenians always
welcomed the foreign craftsmen and the artists and skilled
workmen of other nationalities. In Rome under the
Republic somewhat similar laws to those of Athens existed
against the alien, but with the Empire all disabilities were
swept away, and Rome gladly welcomed all who ministered
to her luxuries and to her pleasures.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that no unprejudiced person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
would desire England to revert to the harsh measures of
the Plantagenet and Tudor kings, still less to stain her
Statute Book by such a measure as the <cite>Droit d'Aubaine</cite>,
however great might be the provocation. Yet the memory
of those acts need not prevent us from considering dispassionately,
and with due regard to the changed circumstances
of our age and country, the advisability of passing
some wise and judicious measure for the sifting of alien
immigration at the present time. The objection to all the
measures to which allusion has been made is, that they
were directed against foreigners simply because they were
foreigners, and not for the reason their presence militated
to any considerable extent against the well-being of the
English community, and certainly not because they added
to overcrowding, to destitution, or to disease. The Flemings
and the Huguenots have their parallels to-day in the foreign
teachers of languages, in the French cooks and milliners, in
the German clerks, cabinet-makers, and waiters; in the
Italian cooks, manufacturers of Venetian glass, &amp;c.; in the
skilled craftsmen of whatever nationality who arrive upon
our shores. Against these no reasonable objection can be
urged. They are useful members of the community, we
gain by their presence among us, and their advent is a
welcome one. But it cannot be seriously contended that
the Flemings and the Huguenots have their parallel in the
destitute and degraded immigrants from East of Europe, or
the vagrant and vicious aliens from the South. Whatever
our sympathies towards these people may be, there is every
reason why we should not welcome them here. As things
are, these new arrivals add in a manner altogether out of
proportion to their numbers to the miseries of our poor in
the congested districts of our great towns, to which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
invariably drift. There are many practical ways in which
we can show our sympathy with the persecuted Russian
Jews if we wish to do so, notably by combining to divert
the stream of immigration from our own densely populated
little island, and by helping the would-be immigrants to
move on to some new land beyond the seas. This we may
do; but for their own sake, and for the sake of our people,
we should try to prevent them from coming here.</p>

<p>With an imperfect knowledge of the facts we are hardly
in a position to judge of the action which the Russian
Government has seen fit to take against its Jewish subjects.
On the surface it certainly appears that a great wrong has
been done, a wrong which is also a blunder, but we must
remember that we have not yet heard what there is to be
urged on the other side. We can scarcely be expected to
credit without adequate proof all the hearsay tales of
Russian oppression. Isolated instances do not suffice. If
a Russian were to make a collection of all the instances of
murder, outrage, and misery which unhappily still stain the
annals of our law-courts, he would hardly present to his
compatriots a faithful picture of English life. Is there not
just a possibility that we may be condemning Russia on
somewhat similar evidence? It is said,&mdash;one cannot say
how truly,&mdash;that the system of usury and extortion practised
by many of the Russian Jews upon the peasantry has, in a
large measure, tended to bring about the present state of
things. Again we are told that the increase of Russian Jews
has of late been so rapid that there is a danger, if things go
on at the present rate, of the orthodox Slavs being swamped
by a section of the population little in sympathy with the
Government under which they live. These are some of
the reasons, we are informed, which have led to the adoption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of harsh measures against the Russian Jews. On the surface
such reasons seem very inadequate, and with the measures
which are said to flow from them no right-thinking man can
have sympathy. For her difficulties with her Jewish population
Russia has only herself to thank. The long years of
oppression to which they have been subjected have degraded
them, until their ignorance and dislike of their masters have
become a danger to the State. Anything which savours of
a religious persecution is abhorrent to all liberal-minded
men; and if it be true, as alleged, that the present sufferings
of the Russian Jews are inflicted upon them because of their
faith, then our sympathies with the victims of such an unholy
persecution cannot be too great. At the same time we are
not in a position to dictate to Russia. Some zealous and
well-meaning people tried the experiment at a meeting at the
Mansion House last year, with the result that they were
virtually told to mind their own business. The "protest,"
however, had one unfortunate consequence. The repressive
measures were made more drastic than before, and the
unfortunate Hebrews, naturally interpreting the sympathy
shown to them as an inducement to come here, have since
arrived upon our hospitable shores in greater numbers than
before. In support of this opinion may be quoted the
following paragraph which appeared in the supplement of
the <cite>St. Petersburger Zeitung</cite> last June.</p>

<p>"We hear that a charitable association has been formed,
with the praiseworthy object of assisting the Russian Jews
out of their present miserable situation. An opportunity is
to be given them of emigrating to those countries where
sympathy has been publicly expressed for them. The first
thing this association intends doing is to send the Jews by
Libau and Riga to London, where public opinion has clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
enough shown itself to be on their side. For this purpose
four steamers are to be chartered to carry these Jews to the
banks of the Thames at the lowest possible rates, and it is
expected that it will take the whole of the summer to carry
out this plan. The philanthropists in St. Petersburg hope
that the friends of the Jews in England will give them their
hearty support, and help to provide for these poor creatures
when they arrive in London."</p>

<p>This is taking us at our word with a vengeance! Surely
for the sake of these poor immigrants themselves it is high
time that some means should be found to prevent their
arriving here in such numbers. The miseries which many
of the Russian Jews undergo in the East End of London
and some of our large provincial cities must be as bad as
those which they have endured in the inhospitable land
from whence they came. In some cases their lot here must
be even worse. Quite recently an instance of the sufferings
which these poor creatures undergo came to light in Whitechapel.
Adolphe Cashneer, a Russo-Jewish immigrant, was
summoned before the coroner of East London<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to give
evidence as to the death of his infant child. The man, who
was unable to speak a word of English, stated that he had
been out of work for six weeks&mdash;he worked in the cheap
tailoring trade&mdash;that the mother had received no medical
attention except a midwife at confinement, no food but
three-halfpennyworth of milk a day, and a share of a fowl
which lasted them five days, and for which the husband had
pawned his trousers. The deceased child had no clothes
but a napkin to cover it. It lived only one week and then
died of starvation! The doctor in describing the wretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
room where these poor people lived, said there were no
sheets or blankets on the bed, the mother had no proper
clothing, and there was no food beyond some sour milk in a
dirty glass, quite unfit for human consumption. A more
impressive object-lesson of the evils of our present system of
unchecked and pauper immigration than that unfolded in
this tale of sordid misery it would be impossible to conceive.
And yet this is by no means an isolated case. Dr. Dukes
stated that he continually came across such cases. He
went on to say in his evidence at the inquest:&mdash;"I continually
come across such cases as this.... The poverty in the
East End is terrible." Instances like this cannot but
strengthen the argument against admitting destitute aliens
here. Strangers in a strange land, these miserable new-comers
find themselves worse off than they were before.
They are not themselves benefited, and the only result is
that they intensify the awful struggle for existence which is
going on daily and hourly among the poor in our large cities.</p>

<p>It has been said that to limit this influx would be to
endanger that right of asylum which has ever been one of
England's boasts and glories. It is not so. Were a careful
and judicious measure passed for the sifting of alien immigration,
it would be quite possible to insert a clause, similar
to that which has been inserted in the new American Act,
which runs as follows:&mdash;"That nothing in this Act shall
be construed to apply to or exclude persons convicted of a
political offence, notwithstanding the said political offence
may be designated as a 'felony, crime, infamous crime, or
misdemeanour involving moral turpitude,' by the laws of
the land whence he came, or by the court convicting."</p>

<p>Such is the law in the "land of the free." England, no
less than America, is the home of civil and religious liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
She has great and glorious traditions; they are illustrated
by her treatment of the Walloons, the Huguenots, the slave-traffic,
and all political refugees from time immemorial.
Yet in the past she has not hesitated from time to time to
pass such laws as need and occasion required. To this the
Statute Book is a witness,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and her traditions would not be
reversed because in the present day she found it necessary,
in the interests of her own people, to adopt some means for
checking this latter-day invasion. What is asked for is not
an offensive but a defensive measure.</p>

<p>England has gained much in the past by her generous
treatment of political refugees. But it must be apparent
to every thoughtful man that the question assumes a very
different aspect when we have to deal not with the influx
of a few thousands of skilled workmen at isolated periods
of our history, but with the invasion of some thirty or forty
thousand every year of the class which under ordinary
circumstances would go to fill the poor-houses and penitentiaries
of Eastern Europe. Such a constant pouring in of
unskilled labour of necessity disorganizes the labour market,
and compels the displacement of English workmen who are
unable to compete on equal terms with rivals such as these.
The results are plainly shown in the trades and districts
chiefly affected. These immigrants undo by their presence
in our midst all the good which our philanthropists and
social reformers have been labouring for ages to create. It
may be true that in the strictly legal sense of the word
comparatively few of them are paupers, since, as Lord
Derby has recently expressed it, "they are quite able to
make their own living." But what a "living" is it? The
living of a savage or a dog, and certainly not one which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
like to see Englishmen or Englishwomen degraded to, or
forced into competition with, in the land that gave them
birth. Boast as we may of the succour which we are ever
ready to afford to the oppressed ones of the earth, it is
obvious that we must first look to the interests of our own
people. Our supineness in this matter has allowed the evil
to grow to a magnitude it ought never to have reached, and
thus the difficulties surrounding it have been greatly increased.
The Government of the day will incur a grave
responsibility if they do not speedily devote their earnest
attention to this matter.</p>

<p>There are signs all around us that before long something
will have to be done. At a time when the country is being
convulsed with conflicts of labour against capital, and when
thousands of our wage-earning classes are looking in vain
for work; at a time when the condition of the poor in our
great cities is engaging the active attention of our philanthropists,
and the columns of the press teem with appeals
for the aid of the homeless and suffering; this ever-increasing
addition to the ranks of our unemployed, with
its inevitable tendency to aggravate our social evils, is
calculated to inspire feelings of alarm and dismay among
all those who have the welfare of our people seriously at
heart.</p>

<h2 class="title"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a>
<br />THE INCREASE AND EXTENT.</h2>


<p>That the immigration of destitute and undesirable
aliens takes place on a large and increasing scale, is a fact
placed beyond the reach of controversy or denial. The
Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to
inquire into the subject, reported that the immigration of
aliens into this country had been greater since the date of
the last Census (1881) than at any recent period of our
history; an opinion which they arrived at from the
evidence of a number of eminent authorities. Mr. John
Burnett, Labour Correspondent of the Board of Trade, who
was specially deputed in August 1887 to make inquiries
into the Sweating System in the East End of London,
reported that matters were much worse there of late years,
because of "the enormous influx of pauper foreigners," an
opinion which he arrived at from his own personal observation,
and from the statements of the people themselves.
Mr. Burnett's report was corroborated in its main features
by Dr. Ogle, whose work it is to prepare the statistical part
of the Census, and whose opinion on all such matters stands
deservedly high.</p>

<p>Let us also take the opinion of people who have lived in
the invaded districts, and who can therefore speak from
practical experience. Mr. Henry Dejonge, a cigar-maker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
who had lived in the East End for fifty years, said before
the Immigration Committee:&mdash;"The increase has taken
place since the Russian War of 1856. Since then it has
been gradual, but sure; there has been a very large increase
the last eight years.... In a certain street in Whitechapel
the shops are mostly kept by foreigners. In Wentworth
Street, out of eighty-five shops, there are forty-eight in the
hands of Russian and Polish Jews." Mr. Simmons, a
dress-trimming maker, said that he was born in Spitalfields,
and could date back in his recollection, "and where there
were then two Jews, there are forty now, or even more&mdash;say
sixty. I know a street which when I was a boy there
was not a Jew in, and now it is completely full of them."
The agent to the Whitechapel Committee of the Charity
Organization Society (Mr. Thurston) was of opinion that
the population in the district of Whitechapel would be half
foreign and half British. "Some of the streets that were
occupied by British workpeople have been entirely cleared,
and are now occupied by Jews." The Rev. H. A. Mason,
Vicar of All Saints, Stepney, a well-known and devoted
clergyman, who has laboured for the last eighteen years
among the lowest of the London poor, reckons that there has
been an increase of 1000 foreign Jews in his parish during
the last seven years, and this at the sacrifice of the British
population. He also testified to the ill-feeling existing
between them and the British part of the population who
found themselves being thus ousted. The Bishop of
Bedford, Dr. Billing, referring to Spitalfields, where he had
laboured for twenty years, said:&mdash;"I know that during the
last four years whole streets have become entirely occupied
by Jews, foreign Jews, where there was not a Jew before."
The Report of the Committee of Guardians of the White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>chapel
Union stated in 1887:&mdash;"There can be no doubt
that the number of foreign residents&mdash;chiefly very poor&mdash;in
the Whitechapel Union and adjacent districts, is largely on
the increase, and that each year sees some new locality, or
localities, invaded by the foreigner and abandoned by the
English poor. No statistics are needed in support of this
statement, since it is obvious to every one who knows the
East End. It is not a mere redistribution of poor, and the
substitution of one class for another in a certain locality;
it is the immigration into the district of a class of foreign
poor, who seem heretofore to have existed on the mere
border-land of civilization, who are content with any
shelter, and to share that shelter with as many of their class
as can be crowded into it."</p>

<p>A mass of similar evidence might be given by experts
whose opinions are above contradiction or cavil. But it is
unnecessary to multiply witnesses. A visit to East London
will give one the best of all possible evidence&mdash;that of one's
own eyes. In Whitechapel, the increase during the last
ten years has been enormous. Whole streets are now filled
with foreign Jews, notably Old Montague Street, Chicksand
Street, Booth Street, Hanbury Street, and the teeming
courts and alleys adjoining. It is easy to imagine oneself
to be in a foreign city. Strange habits and customs, and
foreign faces surround one; and a foreign language is
heard on every side. There are multitudes of little eating-houses
with Hebrew letters on the windows, signifying thus
"Kosher"&mdash;meat prepared in the Jewish fashion&mdash;is there
supplied. There are foreign Jewish tradesmen who drive
a thriving trade in catering to the peculiar wants of this
foreign population, supplying every need, even down to
"smoked beef and sausages from Warsaw," a delicacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which the Polish and Russian Jew especially affects. There
is even a foreign newspaper half printed in "Yiddish," and
the sentiments expressed therein are often of the most
dangerous order. On the walls and other available spaces,
one sees advertisements in Yiddish, and enterprising
tradesmen go in for Yiddish handbills. There are Yiddish
clubs and gambling-hells, and little Jewish lodging-houses
without end. In fact everywhere the signs of this foreign
invasion are dominant, to the complete&mdash;or almost complete&mdash;exclusion
of the English element. That particular
quarter of London is like the Ghetto of a continental city.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police
stated in his last Report that "a growing number of such
passengers (viz. destitute foreigners) arrive in London,
chiefly on board vessels running under the German flag."
After noticing that by one line plying between Hamburg
and Tilbury, no less than 4000 such passengers, 80 per
cent. of whom appeared to be quite destitute, arrived in 1890,
as compared with 2390 in 1889, the Chief Commissioner
notices that "from 4000 to 5000 additional arrived in London
in 1890," and adds, "Though some of these only pass
through London on their way to America, it may be taken
that the majority of them settle there." His conclusion
is:&mdash;"The police reports unanimously state that there has
been a marked increase of late in the number of arrivals in
this country." This report is dated 17th January, 1891.</p>

<p>The increase is by no means confined to London alone.
The Chief Constable at Manchester reported (29th December,
1890), as the result of inquiries of several shopkeepers
and housekeepers from Poland and Russia who
have resided in Manchester for some years, that "all are
unanimously of opinion that the numbers of their countrymen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
who have immigrated into the city have increased
during the last few months." He reports farther (10th
January, 1891), "that there are said to be 15,000 to 16,000
Jews in Manchester, and of their number it has been estimated
that at least 70 per cent. are said to be Russian
Poles. No correct information can be obtained as to the
proportionate number of the whole who are in destitute
circumstances, or of the total increase in the numbers of
these classes which has actually taken place in the year
1890; but there can be no doubt that the Jewish people
have very largely increased in numbers in this city during
the last few years."</p>

<p>The Liverpool Chief Constable reported (January 1891):&mdash;"There
is no doubt, as far as can be ascertained, that the
immigration of destitute Polish and Russian Jews into this
city has somewhat increased during the past twelve months."
The Chief Constable at Glasgow reports, on the authority of
the honorary treasurer of the Jewish Board of Guardians, that
about 200 poor Polish immigrants arrive in that city yearly.
There are a good many foreign Jews settled in Glasgow.</p>

<p>In Leeds, the Chief Constable reported (December 1890),
that there is a continuous immigration of destitute aliens&mdash;Polish
and Russian Jews. A member of the Jewish Board
of Guardians informed him "that the number of Jewish
immigrants arriving in Leeds during the last twelve months
would, in his opinion, be about 2000 persons"; but on this
there appears to be a difference of opinion.</p>

<p>Leeds is a place which calls for more than a mere passing
notice, since it is probably more directly interested in the
question of alien immigration than any other provincial
town in England. The incoming tide flows on unchecked,
and helps to swell the poorer population of Leeds to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
alarming extent. In a Report of the Sweating System at
Leeds, Mr. Burnett, Labour Correspondent to the Board of
Trade, wrote:&mdash;"As elsewhere these people (the Jews) may
be almost said to form a foreign colony in the heart of an
English town, and Leeds has now its Jewish quarter just as
the East End of London has. They have settled down in
a district called the Leylands, and they have taken such
complete possession of it, that in the Board School of the
locality, 75 per cent. of the children are Jews. The streets
in the Leylands are beginning to assume distinctly foreign
characteristics. The names above the shops are foreign,
and the notices in the windows are printed in Hebrew
characters. The words spoken are unintelligible to English
ears, and about the race of the children in the streets and
the people at the doors there can be no mistake."</p>

<p>More recent evidence is afforded by the <cite>Yorkshire Post</cite>
"The great majority of the arrivals," writes this journal,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
"are Russian and Polish Jews, who on landing upon English
soil, at once move to the centre of the clothing industry,
most of them with little or no money in their pockets, many
of them without a trade in their hands, and not a few of
them trusting for safe dealings to their English vocabulary,
which is limited to one word, 'Leeds.' ... It is quite
evident that there has been an increase during the present
year. The persecution of the Semitic race in Russia has
driven immense numbers to seek in this country the hospitable
shelter that is denied them in the land of their birth,
and a not inconsiderable proportion of them having heard
of Leeds as an earthly Paradise for outcasts and wanderers,
direct their steps towards the West Riding capital immediately
the Hamburg boat lands them at Hull."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>Among the evidences of the greater influx into the Jewish
colony of Leeds is the increased number of applications for
help that are being received almost every week by the
Jewish Board of Guardians, and by those who have the
control of the relief funds connected with the various Hebrew
congregations of the town.</p>

<p>No official return is kept of the number of foreign Jews
who come into Leeds, or of those who leave it; absolutely
accurate information as to the exact number of the foreign
colony in Leeds is therefore not to be obtained. But the
Report of the Board of Trade, issued in the spring of 1891,
estimates the Jewish population at 10,000. There are
those, however, who put the number higher than that, the
estimate going up as high as 15,000, or even beyond it.
Be that as it may, it is certain that there has been a very
large increase in 1891. How great is this increase is
shown by the following quotation from a circular recently
issued to the subscribers of the Leylands Gospel Temperance
Mission, signed by the Superintendent of the Mission.
The Leylands is a district of Leeds. The circular says:&mdash;"Careful
inquiries have been made into the great changes
rapidly taking place in the Leylands, owing to the enormously
increased proportion of Jews settling there. As a
result of this, the Byron Street Wesleyan Chapel has been
given up and sold to the Jews, the Roman Catholic Chapel
is also given up, and the English and Irish portion of the
district is removing. A carefully-prepared estimate has
been given of the changes during the past two years, as
follows:&mdash;In 1889 there were in the Leylands 1300 houses.
Of these 621 were occupied by Jews. In 1890, 765
were occupied by Jews, an increase in one year of 144
houses taken by Jews. At present, out of 1300 houses, 900<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
are occupied by Jews (between 30 and 40 of them as workshops),
only leaving about 400 houses in the district
occupied by English and Irish."</p>

<p>To return to London. In addition to the facts already
quoted, we have the evidence of the Jewish Board of
Guardians, evidence surely above suspicion, since that body
is by no means prone to exaggerate the evil of destitute
immigration. In the Annual Report of the Board for 1890,
it is stated that the total number of cases of foreign Jews
"entertained" during that year amounted to 3534. Taking
ten years, we find that in 1880, 2588 cases were relieved,
<em>exclusive</em> of Loan and Industrial Departments, at a cost of
£18,354; in 1890, 3351 cases were relieved, <em>exclusive</em> of
Loan and Industrial Departments, at a cost of £21,648.
The total of absolute gifts in 1880 was £5528; in 1890,
it had run up to £10,776, or nearly double. Moreover, the
Emigration Committee of the Board testify to a decrease in
the number of people assisted to emigrate in 1890. They
admit that, owing to the United States Immigration Laws,
they have to use the greatest circumspection to prevent any
cases being assisted that are likely to be refused admission
on the other side. The Russian Relief Fund Committee
also admit that owing to persecution in Russia they no
longer assist Eastern immigrants to return home even in
cases where it is desirable to send men back to look after
their families. They state that a "large number" of refugees
have been assisted by them to settle here since 1882, and
that they succeed in gaining a livelihood in London.</p>

<p>From special inquiries which have been instituted by the
Association for preventing the Immigration of Destitute
Aliens, it is computed that during the spring, summer, and
autumn months of the present year (1891) some 500 a week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of these alien immigrants have arrived at the port of
London alone. Of these nearly 80 per cent. appeared to be
in a destitute condition. It is to be noted that these
figures do not include those who are stated to be provided
with through tickets to other countries; and though some
may possibly return again to the land from whence they
came, the probability is that most of them remain to glut
the already overcrowded labour market in the East of
London. A few, generally of the least destitute class, drift
on to the manufacturing centres in the North of England;
but the alien population of the provincial cities is mainly
recruited from other ports&mdash;Hull, Leith, Grimsby, and
Southampton.</p>

<p>We now come to the last link in this chain of evidence as
to the increase and extent of alien immigration&mdash;the official
returns of the Board of Trade. I have purposely delayed
considering these returns until the last, as they are in many
ways incomplete and unsatisfactory. Still as they are so
frequently appealed to by those who seek to minimize this
evil, one must refer to them also. As an instance of the way
in which they have been kept, it may be stated at the outset
that, excepting as to London and Hull, the information has
only been obtained from the various ports since the 1st of
May 1890, and only as to London and Hull is a comparison
possible with the previous year. Still even on this unsatisfactory
basis we find that 29,885 aliens arrived from the
Continent, at twenty-one British ports, between May and
December 1890, and at two others in the whole year, not
intending to proceed to America; whilst the arrivals in
London were 4400 more in 1890 than in 1889, and in Hull
1320 higher.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And this in spite of the fact that nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
1,000,000 persons were maintained under the Poor Law in
Great Britain during 1890! The returns issued by the
Board of Trade for 1891 are even more alarming. The
total of aliens "not stated to be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to America" who
arrived in the United Kingdom during the ten months
ending the 31st of October, 1891, amounted to no less
than 32,877.</p>

<p>These figures appear upon the showing of the official
returns, and taking them as they stand, how people,
however optimistic, can derive any consolation from them,
it is not easy to imagine. But there is no doubt that
were these returns actually complete, carefully prepared,
and accurately checked, it would be found that the number
of aliens who arrived upon our shores would be very much
in excess of the number given.</p>

<p>The actual numerical work of compiling the returns is
done at the Board of Trade; but the collection of material
is directed and superintended by the Commissioners of
Customs; and the efficiency of the work turns upon
the way in which the Alien Act of William IV. is
administered.</p>

<p>Summing up briefly the chief provisions of that Act, which
are given <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i> elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> it will be seen that&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
The master of a vessel arriving from a foreign port is to
declare in writing to the chief officer of the Customs at the
port of arrival, the number of the aliens who are on board,
or have landed from his vessel; and to give the names,
rank, occupations, and description of such aliens, so far as
he shall be informed thereof; and if a master omits to make
such declaration, or wilfully makes a false one, he is liable
to a penalty. (<i>b</i>) Every alien on arrival is to declare in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
writing to the chief officer of Customs at the port of debarkation,
his name, description, etc., and every such officer
is to register the declaration, and deliver to the alien a
certificate, which is to be given up to the chief officer of
customs at the port of departure, when the alien leaves the
country. (<i>c</i>) The chief officer of Customs at every port is
to transmit to one of Her Majesty's principal Secretaries
of State&mdash;in practice the Home Secretary&mdash;a copy of the
master's declaration, a copy of the certificate given to the
alien, and the certificate which the alien gives up on leaving
the country.</p>

<p>This sounds all very well in theory, and there is no doubt
that if the provisions of the Act were carried out to the
letter, we should be in possession of what we have not now&mdash;actual
statistics, which must precede legislation. But the
question is, what about the practice? Mr. Lindsey, the
chief of the Long-room at the London Custom-house, told
the Immigration Committee in 1888 that the Act had long
since fallen into desuetude; and that only at the ports of
London and Hull did the masters of vessels, at that date,
report the number of aliens on board, or make any declaration
whatever, while no means at all existed for checking
the lists supplied. Indeed, it would be quite possible, he
considered, for vessels to land "thousands of aliens" without
the Customs authorities being able to find it out. No
declarations were made or certificates given to aliens on
arrival, or received from them on departure, as directed by
sec. vi. of the Alien Act of William IV. It is evident,
therefore, that up to that date the Act had been allowed to
become practically obsolete.</p>

<p>After the Immigration Committee had used their Report
in 1889, in which they recommended that measures should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
be taken to secure with more frequency and greater accuracy
an estimate of the amount of alien immigration into the
United Kingdom, tardy steps were taken to obtain certain
statistics; but it was not till May 1890, and after questions
had been frequently asked in either House of Parliament,
that alien lists were taken at ports other than London and
Hull. Even now, though an attempt has been made to
procure lists of aliens from a considerable number of ports,
yet on the face of the monthly returns the lists are,
admittedly, very imperfect. The lists received from Dover,
Folkestone, and Harwich are only partial; while other ports
of considerable importance, such as Lynn, Newhaven, Southampton,
and many of the western ports, are omitted altogether.
In all cases the masters of the vessels are perfectly
able to shirk their duties if so inclined; so that not only
are the returns very incomplete, but even the statistics given
are very untrustworthy.</p>

<p>I have the best authority for making this charge as to the
untrustworthy nature of the statistics given, which is so
strenuously denied by those who put their faith in the
official returns. My authority is a letter written to me on
the 23rd April, 1891, by the Secretary of the Customs, in
which he says:&mdash;"I am directed to acquaint you that the
Department does not undertake in any way to check the
returns of aliens made by the captains of the vessels, under
the requirements of the Act of William IV.; and that the
Customs Boarding Staff, as at present arranged, could not
undertake such a duty without additional expense to the
public, even if directions to that effect should be received
from the Government."</p>

<p>This is perfectly natural and reasonable as coming from
the Customs. The letter is merely quoted here to show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
it is impossible to place faith in the present returns. It
practically admits the whole contention: the alien lists are
unchecked, and therefore unsatisfactory. A glance at the
way in which they are prepared will show how unsatisfactory
they are.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, the provisions of the Alien Act
of William IV. have been allowed to fall into disuse, and the
penalties for neglect of carrying them out are never enforced.
Hitherto even such returns as have been sent in, have been
loosely and carelessly prepared. In some cases masters of
ships have neglected to render any returns of the aliens on
board their vessels; in others, the duty, instead of being
performed by the captain or master of the vessel, as the Act
requires, has been delegated to some inferior officer, with the
result that the work has been performed in a hasty and perfunctory
manner. But, however carelessly these lists are
prepared, the Custom House authorities accept them just
as they are, and no provision has been made for checking
them. It is obvious that statistics prepared in such a
manner are of no great value. Yet it is upon the authority
of such returns as these that we are asked to disbelieve
the evidence of our own eyes, and to admit that the matter
is not of sufficient urgency to claim the attention of the
Government.</p>

<p>With regard to the steps which the Board of Trade are
said to be taking to ensure more accurate statistics, it was
stated by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach last session that in future
the number of aliens on board the incoming vessels would
be every now and then counted, and comparisons made
with the master's returns. "Every now and then" is very
vague; and until a check is systematically and regularly
imposed upon the number of alien passengers on every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
ship arriving at all the ports, we cannot be sure of obtaining
accurate returns. This vague promise on the part of the
President of the Board of Trade was made&mdash;it should be
noted&mdash;after a prolonged correspondence had taken place
between that Department and the Association for Preventing
the Immigration of Destitute Aliens. The Association, on
the strength of the letter from the Secretary of the Customs,
already quoted, had asked the permission of the Board of
Trade&mdash;as the returns were admittedly unchecked&mdash;for its
agent to be allowed, at the Association's expense, to go on
board the incoming vessels for the purpose of checking the
returns rendered by the masters. This request was met by
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non possumus</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; and the Board of Trade wrote to say that
though they had "no reason to believe that the returns
hitherto received have been in fact inaccurate, arrangements
have been made for a further check to be applied to the
returns in future by the officers of the Customs when on
board the ships." How far these vague promises given on
the part of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach in the House of
Commons, and by the Department in the letter quoted, have
been redeemed, it is impossible to say. The promise of a
"further check" is not more reassuring, than Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach's "every now and then," especially when we
bear in mind that it had been admitted that hitherto there
had been absolutely no check at all. All that one knows
for certain is that up to the present no action has been
taken against the masters or owners of any ships, if the lists
have been found to be incorrect.</p>

<p>Such then is a sketch of the way in which the Government
figures are obtained, and of the efforts which have been
made to secure their greater accuracy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In compiling the alien lists in the future, some more
definite information should also be forthcoming as to the
means, nationality, and destination of the immigrants. The
distinction "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to America" is altogether inadequate
for practical purposes. As matters stand, it is the only clue
afforded us for judging which of the immigrants are merely
birds of passage, or which come to settle here. Of course
some of those who are "not stated to be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to
America" return again to the Continent; but against that
unknown and altogether hypothetical number, may fairly be
set the incomplete nature of the returns, and the practice so
generally followed in preparing the alien lists of counting
two children as one adult. As most of the immigrants
against whom complaint is chiefly made do not come here
alone, but with their families&mdash;and often large families&mdash;this
is a point to be noted in considering the actual
numerical value of the Board of Trade returns. Therefore,
in making a rough estimate, I do not think I shall be far
wrong if I consider the number of aliens classed in the
Board of Trade returns as "not being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to America,"
as practically representing about the number of those who
remain here.</p>

<p>As matters stand, it is of course at present impossible to
give the exact number; but such an estimate would be
approximately correct. Nevertheless, in a letter to the
<cite>Times</cite> in the month of August last, an official of the Board
of Trade, writing under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de guerre</i> of "Facts," did
not hesitate to charge me with "attempted misrepresentation,"
and "an intention to create prejudice," because I
estimated that the number of aliens quoted in the official
returns as "not being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to America," would probably
represent about the number of those who come here to settle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
The animus displayed in this letter was doubtless engendered
by the remembrance of a previous epistolary duel.
Opinions may differ as to the importance to be attached to
this question of alien immigration; they may differ also as
to the value of the Board of Trade returns; but however this
may be, to write letters under a feigned name to the papers,
deliberately accusing one's opponent of bad faith, is a
method of conducting or prolonging a controversy happily
rare. Though you may disagree with another man's
views, you have no right to accuse him of dishonesty
because he happens to differ from you.</p>

<p>After the correspondence in the <cite>Times</cite> took place, a note
was appended to the monthly returns issued by the Board
of Trade, to the effect that it was not implied "that the
aliens not stated to be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to America, come to this
country for settlement; there being in fact a large emigration
of foreigners from this country, while many of the
aliens arriving from continental ports return again to the
Continent." This clears the ground a little, and so far
the correspondence cannot be said to have been altogether
barren of results. The announcement that there is a large
emigration of foreigners from this country is quite gratuitous,
however, since we know that the number of aliens who
came here <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to America, in the ten months ending
31st October, 1891, amounted to no less than 88,617. That
does not affect the matter under consideration in the slightest.
But the statement that "many of the aliens arriving from
continental ports return again to the Continent" cannot be
allowed to pass so easily. How is this conclusion arrived
at? No account of foreigners leaving this country for
European ports is taken. Of course many return, but who
are they? Principally tourists, business men, and the better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
class of foreigners, against whom no complaint is made.
But the great bulk of these <em>are not included in the official
returns at all</em>, for the alien lists received from Dover,
Folkestone, and Harwich, the three ports to which that class
of foreigner generally comes, "show only deck passengers,
and persons who on landing proceed by train as third-class
passengers."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In making a fair estimate, therefore, the
better class of foreigner can hardly be taken into consideration
at all. This reduces the number of those included in
the official returns "who return again to the Continent" to
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimum</i>. Those against whom complaint is made&mdash;the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">residuum</i>, the worthless, and the unfit&mdash;remain with us. They
could not return to the Continent even if they wished to do
so, for the simple reason that they would not be received
back again. The law, for instance, in Hamburg is to the
effect that no person without means is to land at that port.
Hamburg is the great port from which the destitute aliens
take ship to England; and therefore it is apparent that
though steamship companies may land upon our shores any
number of destitute or semi-destitute passengers they please,
they dare not take back these same passengers to Hamburg,
even if they should wish to go.</p>

<p>Hence, it may be fairly said that this "immigrant emigration,"
upon which the Board of Trade appears to lay so
much stress, is inconsiderable, and at any rate does not
touch the class against which complaint is chiefly made.
Against it, is to be set the incomplete nature of the lists
actually rendered; the fact that the returns are not
received from <em>all</em> the ports of the United Kingdom; the
untrustworthiness of such as are received; and the practice in
preparing them of counting two children to one adult. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
all these considerations be balanced against the unknown
number of aliens "who return again to the Continent" or
move on elsewhere, it certainly cannot be said, that, in
estimating the number of those who are stated to be "not
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to America," as the approximate number of those
who remain here, one is guilty of exaggeration. If anything,
one under-estimates rather than overstates the case.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, that all attempts to bolster up the
official returns, so long as they are compiled in the present
manner, is foredoomed to failure. They are about as unsatisfactory
and as inadequate as they can well be, and the
distrust with which they are viewed is widespread. The
importance of trustworthy official statistics upon this matter
can hardly be overrated. So long as they are wanting, there
will always be a tendency to exaggerate the evil on the one
hand, and to minimize it on the other. Things are bad
enough as they are, and there is nothing to be gained by
exaggeration. It is greatly to be hoped that the present
Government, which has done much in the way of good and
useful reform, will take steps to wipe away this reproach&mdash;for
it is nothing less than a reproach&mdash;that, while we have
such admirable statistics as to the imports of merchandise,
the returns as to the importation of human beings should
remain in their present imperfect state.</p>

<br />JEWISH IMMIGRATION.</h2>


<p>In this chapter I propose to consider the nature of the
immigration. At the outset of this particular aspect of
the question, it is necessary to make it clear that one is
animated by no sentiments of racial or religious animosity.
Nothing could be more undesirable than to treat this
question as a sectarian question, or to cast any slur upon
the Hebrew faith. Nothing would harm the movement
more than to create a <cite>Judenhetze</cite> in England, the home
of religious liberty; and therefore whenever the term
"Jew" is used throughout this volume, it is used merely
to distinguish between other races and nationalities, and
from no desire to arouse the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">odium theologicum</i>. This
disclaimer may seem unnecessary to some, but it is important
to emphasize it, because if there is one thing hateful to
the people of this country, it is religious intolerance; if there
is one thing dear to them, it is that liberality which in
matters of this kind recognizes no distinctions of faith or
creed. It is perfectly true that a large proportion of these
undesirable visitors are Jewish by race and religion. But
that has nothing to do with the objection to them; it
would be just the same if they were Christians, Mahommedans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Buddhists, or sun-worshippers. The objection to
them is simply this, that by coming into certain trades and
industries in this country, they subject our own people to a
constant and unfair competition, which renders it impossible
for them to obtain a decent livelihood, and tends directly
to militate against their physical, financial, social, and
moral well-being. In this matter there is nothing of race,
nothing of religion, except so far as this, that we recognize
that our first duty should be towards our own nation, our
own flesh and blood. Nor is this objection by any means
confined to destitute foreign Jews; it holds equally good
with regard to vagrant and vicious Italians, idle Hungarians,
degraded Chinese, and all the other undesirable specimens
of those nationalities which go to make up the motley
horde. Still it is idle to deny, in dealing with this question,
that though the immigrants are of all nationalities, by far the
greater part of those objected to is composed of Russian,
Roumanian, and Polish Jews, drawn from the class which
goes to swell the poor-houses and penitentiaries of Eastern
Europe.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter I have dwelt upon the numbers
of this particular class of alien immigrants. It is not
necessary, therefore, to go over the same ground again. It
suffices to point out that this increase, which would be
undoubtedly serious if it were distributed impartially throughout
the United Kingdom, assumes a far more formidable
aspect when we consider its distribution in particular
localities and particular trades. The invading hordes of
destitute Jews appear to flock chiefly to our great centres of
population, such as the East End of London, and to the
great manufacturing cities of the North&mdash;Birmingham,
Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Glasgow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Edinburgh, and some other Scotch towns. Now it is
evident that thickly-populated districts do not require
immigration, but emigration. It is evident also that the
Jew in England is not pastoral, but gregarious. Experts,
whose opinions must be listened to with all deference, tell
us that many of the foreign Jews have in them the making
of good colonists and admirable agriculturalists. It may
be so; but those who come here appear to show a marked
distaste for agricultural and all pastoral pursuits. No one
in England ever comes across a Jewish farmer, or a Jewish
agricultural labourer. These immigrants invariably turn
their backs on thinly-populated districts; and wherever our
people are most closely huddled together, wherever the
struggle for existence is keenest, there will the greatest
number of foreign Jews be found, with the inevitable result
that the conditions of life become even harder than before.
It is very necessary to consider the distribution of this
unlimited immigration, if we are to form an adequate idea
of the injury it works upon our own people.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to feel compassion for these poor
Jewish immigrants, when we consider the condition in which
the great majority of them land upon our shores. They are
often of poor physique, and always scantily clad. In most
instances, they are without money at all; others have a few
thalers, or roubles, or marks, as the case may be; and of
these they are quickly eased by the loafers, touts, and
rascals of all descriptions who hang about the docks waiting
their arrival, and professing to show them where to lodge
for the night, or where to find employment.</p>

<p>One ceases to wonder at the destitute condition in which
these unfortunate people arrive on our shores, when we
consider the discomforts and miseries which they have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
undergo before they arrive at our ports. So far as the
Jewish immigrants are concerned, it may be said that fully
70 per cent. of those who have arrived at the port of
London during the present year have come from Russia or
Poland. The edict in Russia has gone forth for their
departure, but before departing it is necessary for them to
obtain a passport and other official documents, which have
to be paid for at the time of application, and are subsequently
required to be shown to the Russian officials before
crossing the frontier. I believe that some negotiations are
now pending with regard to relaxing the severity of the passport
regulations; but at present the possession of a passport
is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</i>. To avoid the expense and trouble of
obtaining these documents, many subterfuges are resorted to,
to enable the Jews to leave unnoticed; but on arriving at the
frontier <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to Hamburg, and being found without these
documents, many of the emigrants are subjected to the
grossest maltreatment and robbery. It is said that many of
them have been robbed of every coin, and almost every
article they possess, and are sent across the frontier in an
absolute state of beggary and destitution. Many cases are
known to the officials of the Jewish Charitable Institutions
in London, where whole families have had, in consequence
of being thus robbed, to tramp on foot through Germany
ten or sixteen days, in order to reach Hamburg <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to
London. When once they arrive at Hamburg, the departure
of these persons is by some mysterious means, which I have
been unable to ascertain, directly provided for. It is not an
expensive journey, the passage to London from Hamburg
being about sixteen shillings English money per head for
the adults, and the children come half-price. These are
approximately the fares charged by Messrs Perlbach, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
do a thriving trade in bringing these people across. I say
"approximately," for Messrs Perlbach have met all my
requests for information with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non possumus</i>. Of course
such a cheap rate does not admit of many comforts. The
emigrant has to find himself all food and bedding. In
most cases the boats are entirely devoid of sufficient accommodation
for passengers; and being under a foreign flag,
they do not come under our Board of Trade regulations here.</p>

<p>The accommodation on board the boats plying between
Hamburg and London is miserably insufficient; and doubtless
it is no better between Hamburg and other English
ports. The voyage from Hamburg to London usually
occupies from forty to sixty hours, according to the weather;
and during the whole of this time these poor people are
herded together rather like cattle than human beings. Men,
women, and children are crowded together in the stifling
atmosphere between the decks; some lying on bundles of
foul and dirty rags, others squatting on the bare deck itself.
It is a terrible picture of famished and suffering humanity.
No one thinks of taking off his clothes during the passage,
and few have either the inclination, or the opportunity, to
wash themselves or their children. The sanitary arrangements
are simply abominable. The following account, given
by the special commissioner of a London evening journal,
which has done much to bring this evil prominently before
the public, and to which I gladly acknowledge my indebtedness,
may with advantage be quoted here. The special
commissioner travelled over from Hamburg as a "destitute
alien" on board Messrs. Perlbach and Co.'s steamship
<cite>Minerva</cite>. In his report he describes his experience as
follows<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"By the time I got on deck darkness had set in, and
nearly all my fellow-aliens had stowed away the pocket-handkerchiefs
or canvas-bags containing their belongings in
one or other of the two holds, which were to form their
place of residence for the next two nights at any rate. I saw
some scores of eyes peering at me for the first minute or
two; then when curiosity as to the new arrival had abated,
I sat down in a dark corner and quietly examined my
surroundings. The greater portion of the deck was taken
up by large boxes covered with sheets of canvas, and
extending to a height in some places of perhaps eight or ten
feet. On the top of these, and in the narrow passages between
them, the emigrants sat or stood, breaking the stillness
of the evening with the hollow laugh or clamorous chatter.
Most of them were young women, wearing shawls on their
heads, and clad in soiled, faded, and torn finery. Some of
them were men, young or middle-aged, but so enfeebled
and spiritless that one might have fixed their age at nearer
seventy than thirty. A few were old women, bent, emaciated,
and almost lifeless. All, with few exceptions, were
yellow with dirt, and smelt foully.... I thought it to
be about time to go and look after my sleeping quarters.
There were two places from which to choose. One of
these, according to the inscription on the entrance, was
constructed to hold thirty-four persons, the other twenty-nine.
The German ships are subject to practically no
regulations as to space; and I inferred there must be on
board about one hundred deck passengers.... I made
my way to the larger of the two steerage cabins. When I
got to the top of the gangway, the stench which issued from
the semi-darkness beneath was pretty nearly unendurable,
and it was even worse down-stairs, when blended with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
heat from the bodies of the emigrants. But the scene which
the place presented was still more disgusting. The apartment
was about the breadth of the ship near the narrow end
in width, and scarcely so long. In the centre a single oil-lamp
was hanging, which threw out a feeble, flickering light.
On each side a couple of platforms were erected, one over
the other, with about two and a half feet between them,
divided into spaces in some places a little over two feet
broad, and not divided at all in others. Here men, women,
and children were lying on the bare boards partly undressed,
some in one direction, some in another. Young
men lay abreast of young unmarried women, chatting jocularly,
and acting indecently, and young children were
witnesses of all that passed. The greater portion of the
floor was taken up with boxes, on which such of the
emigrants of both sexes as had not been able to obtain
the ordinary sleeping accommodation were reclining as best
they might."</p>

<p>That was the first night of the voyage; the second is
described by the commissioner as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My second night's experience in the hold I need say
little about; the horrors of the place were increased by the
accumulation of filth, which had taken place by the ever-increasing
indisposition of the passengers the longer we were
at sea.... Through the long weary hours I sat there
sleepless, I was only too glad when the light of morning
made a promenade possible on deck."</p>

<p>Such are some of the miseries of the journey. It is small
wonder then that under such circumstances, when the vessels
reach London, these unfortunate people present a most
squalid, dirty, and uninviting appearance. The journey is
a wretched one; and at the end of it things are no better;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
for when London is reached, these poor creatures are cast
adrift to fight for themselves, in a population already teeming
with starving, dying thousands.</p>

<p>The steamers that bring these aliens to London always land
them at one of three places&mdash;Tilbury Docks, the Upper Pool,
or St. Katherine's Docks. Wapping is the worst of the three
places of landing. Here the steamers lie out in the middle
of the Thames; the passengers are bundled into boats, the
watermen in charge of which will endeavour before landing
to get as much out of them as they possibly can. They are
landed in different places, their luggage is thrown out of the
boat, and they find themselves alone in a strange land
unable to make known where they wish to go. But they
are not left long in their loneliness. A number of human
sharks, generally foreign Jews also, surround them, anxious
to see in what way they can take advantage of their
ignorance and friendlessness. The worst foes that have to
be contended against are some of the East End boarding-house
keepers. These men will meet the new-comers,
address them in "Yiddish," say that they are connected
with some of the Jewish charities, and tell them that they
must allow their luggage to be collected. When this is done,
they get together as many as possible before being stopped
by the real agents of the Jewish Homes, and march them
off, not to where the unfortunates think they are going, but
to some of the boarding-houses in Spitalfields. Arrived
there, the aliens undergo a process of sifting. Those who
are absolutely destitute, and without money or baggage, from
whom there is nothing to be got, are quickly dismissed, and
sent in charge of a child to the Poor Jews' Temporary
Shelter in Leman Street. But those who have money and
baggage are advised to stay a day or two until they can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
"look about them." Then the fleecing commences. A
charge is made of from two shillings to five shillings a week
for a wretched shake-down bed; but the lodger has to pay
the full week if he only stays one night. Food is charged
in proportion. The next morning, as soon as the lodger
has finished his breakfast, a man is deputed to go with him
in search of employment. This man will tramp his victim
all round London, it need scarcely be said with no success;
in the evening he will bring him back to the boarding-house,
saying they must try again the next day. The following
morning the same routine is gone through, and with the
same result. For each day's service a charge of five shillings
is made. These gross charges are made day after day until
the unfortunate individual has nothing left but his luggage.
The boarding-house keeper sympathizes with his dupe; he
tells him he is not an unkindly man, and will lend him a
trifle on his luggage. This little is soon swallowed up in
the cost of living, and when it is all gone the boarding-house
keeper informs him he is very sorry, but he must have his
room for some one else. The man is turned into the street,
friendless, penniless, and homeless, and finds himself in
very truth a "destitute alien."</p>

<p>Thus such an one becomes in a few weeks precisely in the
same plight as those who arrive with literally nothing at all.
Of those, said the Bishop of Bedford in his evidence before
the House of Lords' Committee, "They almost stand in the
market after arrival with barely any clothes to cover them,
and without a penny in their pockets." In this veritable
slave-market they hang about in droves, waiting for the
sweater to come and hire them, which he does sometimes
in person, sometimes by means of an agent, and sometimes
by means of his wife. (What a terrible type of womanhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
must be a sweater's wife!) Of course these poor creatures
are at the sweater's mercy. They are ignorant of the country,
of its language, of its laws, and are compelled to take any
terms he may offer.</p>

<p>To call the place where these transactions are carried on
a "slave-market" is perhaps an abuse of terms, since, in a
strictly literal sense, nobody buys and nobody sells; but
that it is a traffic in human beings cannot be denied.
Almost any Sunday morning during the spring, summer,
and autumn months, at the corner of Goulston Street,
Whitechapel, for instance, may be seen a varying number
of men drawn up in a line against the wall. In front of
them stands a man who engages&mdash;I will not say sells&mdash;them
to the sweater, who gets his victims to sign a paper, binding
them to work for so many weeks and at so much money in
the sweating dens. It is a pitiful sight. Most of these men
are newly-arrived foreign paupers, chiefly Polish Jews. The
boat from Hamburg arrives every Saturday at the docks,
and the agent who meets them conveys them to some
Jewish shelter where they remain until Sunday morning,
when he leads them to this place. Most of them as they
stand there have the high boots and fur cap distinctive of
the Russian peasant. Want and long service are plainly
written on their emaciated forms, and along with these a
certain patient and dogged intention of purpose. Often the
sweater will give them at first only their food and lodgings,
such as it is. The salary given them varies from two to
three shillings per week; their food is horrible, so is their
lodging. They will work fourteen, sixteen, and eighteen
hours a day, and they will sleep in the den in which the
work is done. They suffer hunger, cold, heat, and vermin.
They are without the help of relations, acquaintances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
or protection. They agree to pay back a certain sum if
they break their engagement; and as this is impossible for
them to do, they remain practically slaves, working for
nothing, or next to nothing.</p>

<p>Most of them have to learn a trade at first, during which
period they earn nothing, and are glad to submit to any
terms the sweater may think fit to impose. The slang term
for such persons is "greener," and in many respects the
condition of a "greener" is worse than that of a slave. By
and by when he has learnt his business, which in the cheap
tailoring trade, for instance, would be the machine work,
he receives a small wage, from six to seven shillings a week,
barely sufficient to maintain existence. As a rule the
"greeners" are very quick to learn, and as they progress
they earn a little more; but their position is precarious, being
liable to be discharged at a moment's notice. The work is
precarious too, and the wages are irregularly paid. Sometimes
there is nothing to do for weeks and weeks. Their
food is of the scantiest, the refuse of fish and a little bread
being the principal articles of diet. The length of hours
for which they work&mdash;I speak now of the cheap tailoring
trade&mdash;averages from fourteen to fifteen hours a day, or
100 hours a week. The Bishop of Bedford said:&mdash;"I
have myself seen these poor creatures at work up till two
in the morning, and I have found that they were again
at work, the same people in the same room, at seven o'clock
in the morning." Again he said:&mdash;"You can tell work is
being done on the Sabbath, by the blinds being drawn. There
is no holiday at all." Moreover, the surroundings amid which
they work are deplorable and filthy in the extreme. That,
however, will be touched upon more fully in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, in the cheap boot trade, the "greener" is at first
put to work as a "sew-round hand." If he does well at
this, in a short time he will proceed to "finishing," and he
is advanced to other branches of the work as his proficiency
may warrant. The master bootmaker, who in nine cases
out of ten was once a "greener" himself, is called a "boot-slosher."
The "greener" will generally lodge at the house
of the "slosher" who employs him; and as many as sixteen
or seventeen of these "greeners" have been known to lodge
in his house at the same time. The daily food, as a rule,
consists of a piece of hard stale bread, dipped in salad oil.
The bread is bought from a barrow in the street, and
consists of the stale unsaleable loaves collected from
various bakers' shops in the neighbourhood. The "greener"
may supplement this possibly with a little weak coffee or
cocoa; or, if he wishes to indulge in an unusual extravagance,
he will invest in a piece of dried cucumber, pickled
in salt and water; or perhaps two or three "greeners," by
way of a treat, will go shares in a few Dutch herrings, also
pickled in salt. The dried pickled cucumber is known
as "Wally-Wally," and a herring is known as a "Deütcher."
These articles are sold in large quantities in the East
End.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that these men remain
always in this position. When they have learned to speak
the language and to know their way about, they will make
better terms for themselves. By degrees they gradually get
on. After being in the "slosher's" shop for six or eight
months, they learn sufficient to enable them to go into the
boot manufactories kept by foreigners, and to apply for
work to take out in large quantities. By a process of
gradual development, the "greener" becomes a "slosher"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
himself, and in the fulness of time he may be seen walking
about the East End, accosting and offering employment to
the first batch of recently-arrived immigrants he sees. More
probably he will meet them at the railway-station and waterside;
or if in a more extensive way of business, he will
write to Hamburg to some of the agencies there, stating
that he can find work for so many men. When he gets
them into his clutches he treats them in precisely the same
way as that in which he himself has been treated. Thus
does this evil system go on and flourish.</p>

<p>After a time the foreign Jew begins to accumulate money;
and though he still continues his frugal diet of "Wally-Wally"
and "Deütcher," he launches forth a little in other
ways. The long Russian coat is discarded, and with it the
Hessian boots and fur cap. He bedizens himself out with
a quantity of cheap flashy jewellery, and possibly goes in
for mild theatrical amusements. There is a small theatre
in a certain small court in Whitechapel, where well-known
English plays are acted in "Yiddish." Here may be seen
the smart young foreign Jews and Jewesses, arrayed in all
their glory, on every night of the week except Friday, when
the Hebrew Sabbath, which nearly all Hebrews outwardly
respect, commences. He may also perhaps join the
"Chovevi Zion"&mdash;Hebrew for "lovers of Zion"&mdash;a society
which sprang into existence in the East End of London
about twelve months ago; or he may possibly&mdash;very probably&mdash;join
one of the many little gambling-hells so greatly
affected by the foreign Jew. Worst of all, he may drift
into one of the secret socialistic or foreign revolutionary
societies which abound in that part of the metropolis.
That such societies exist cannot be doubted. They are
formed of the class of men who marched to Hyde Park the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
other day, with a banner inscribed "Down with the Czar."
These societies have papers of their own circulated among
themselves, written in "Yiddish," breathing the vilest of
political sentiments&mdash;Nihilism of the most outrageous
description.</p>

<p>Thus whole districts in the East of London are as foreign
as in Warsaw, or the Ghetto&mdash;when there was a Ghetto&mdash;in
Rome.</p>

<p>In considering the nature of Jewish immigration, allusion
should also be made to a species of infamy which, I am
credibly informed, has been carried on for some time past
at the London Docks. Many of the immigrants are young
women, Jewesses of considerable personal attractions. Men-sharks,
and female harpies of all descriptions, are on the
look-out for them as soon as they disembark. The young
women are approached, and asked in "Yiddish" whether
they are in want of work. The answer of course is in the
affirmative, especially as many of these young Jewesses
arrive in a friendless condition. "Then," comes the suggestion,
"you had better come and stay with me until you
get it," or "I can put you in the way of obtaining it." Of
course this dodge does not always succeed, for many young
Jewesses are by no means so guileless as they appear to be.
But in two cases out of three it does. The girl, friendless
and unprotected, goes off with her interlocutor, and then
the old shameful story is repeated. She stays in the house
until the little she has is more than due for board; her
efforts to earn an honest living are in vain; and when she
is destitute, she is told she must either leave the place,
minus even her little baggage, or earn money at the expense
of her virtue. Such a dilemma, in nine cases out of ten,
presents only one means of escape; and the girl goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to swell the number of the lost and degraded of our great
cities. One of the worst features of this system is, that
the decoy is largely carried on by Englishmen and Englishwomen,
and by no means confined to foreigners alone.
Happily, a Jewish Ladies' Rescue Society has been recently
formed, and its efforts have done something to mitigate the
evil. An official from this society goes down to the docks
for the purpose of warning female immigrants, and advising
them where to find employment. But the difficulty still
remains, and a very serious one it is.</p>

<p>When we come to inquire into the causes which bring so
many of these foreign Jews to our shores, we find that in
addition to the two principal reasons&mdash;the persecutions in
Russia, and the American Immigration Laws, which render
their admission to that country impracticable&mdash;there are
other agencies at work as well. The existence of these
agencies is a disputed question; but from inquiries which
have been made, there is every reason to believe that many
of the East End sweaters have agents abroad working on
their behalf. The victims are caught by advertisements in
the obscure Continental papers inserted by the "greener
slave-agent," who sends batch after batch of poor Jews to
this country, and they soon find their way into the sweaters'
dens by means of the addresses given them. This method
of advertisement is perhaps not so extensively carried on as
formerly, but it still exists. Again, there is also the
suspicion, which deepens almost into a certainty, of the
existence of what is known in America as "steamship-solicitation."
It is highly probable that some of the steamship
companies principally concerned in bringing these
people to England, have agents on the Continent engaged
in persuading poor Jews, and poor foreigners generally, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
come to this country with the delusive idea that they will
find plenty of employment, and plenty of pecuniary assistance
here. The notices which the Government have
recently caused to be posted up at some of the European
ports, may do something to nullify this; but the fact remains
that there are several German steamship lines doing an
enormous business in bringing these Jewish immigrants to
our shores, and there are owners of British vessels also
engaged in the same traffic. In America, where it had
reached a very great extent, this "steamship-solicitation"
has been declared illegal. How far the steamship agencies
act in collusion with the sweaters' agents in England, it is
not possible to say&mdash;or, indeed, if they are in collusion at
all. One can only notice that all things work together in a
very remarkable manner. A slight clue to the puzzle is
afforded by the fact that in Leeds (according to the Report
of the Chief Commissioner of Police) there exists a firm of
money-lenders who advance money to Jewish applicants
having friends in Russia and Poland, which is employed
for the purpose of bringing them to this country. This will
explain how some, at any rate, of these destitute immigrants
manage to pay their passage-money to England.</p>

<p>There is another cause also, which is more controversial,
but which must be touched upon all the same, since it is a
very potent one in attracting destitute Jews to England. I
allude to the well-known munificence of the wealthy English
Jews, who are ever ready to help their poorer brethren.
The admirably organized system of benevolence which they
have gradually built up by means of charitable organizations,
shelters, and similar institutions, constitutes nothing less
than an open advertisement to the poor Jews all over
Europe to come to England and have their wants supplied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
I admit that these institutions are not intended to have that
effect, and that many leading English Jews endeavour to
discourage this immigration; but all the same they tend to
have the result of drawing people here.</p>

<p>In Leeds, for example, the Jewish Board of Guardians
give the new arrivals a small grant until they have obtained
work, and if they know no trade, and are willing to learn
one, the Jewish Board will make them an allowance until
they are able to earn something for themselves. In
London, as I have before stated, the number of cases
relieved by the Jewish Board of Guardians in 1890, <em>exclusive</em>
of Loan and Industrial Departments, was 3351,
representing with dependent families 12,047 individuals,
and this at a cost of £21,648. Of course, this refers to the
resident Jewish population as well, the operations of the
Russian and Board Conjoint Committee not being included
in this statement. In fairness it should be stated that the
Jewish Board of Guardians also assist many to emigrate,
and generally endeavour to reduce the mischievous effects
of charitable agencies to a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimum</i>. But there are other
<em>institutions</em> whose philanthropic activity assumes a more
questionable shape. Such, for instance, is the "Poor Jews'
Temporary Shelter," which it can hardly be doubted attracts
many destitute Jews to this country, since in 1888 it
provided board and lodging for a period of from one to
fourteen days to 1322 homeless immigrants.</p>

<p>A similar charge has been brought against the "London
Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews." I
have gone very carefully into this charge, and find that
it is a groundless one. Not only is the Society opposed to
the wholesale influx of foreign Jews, but the number of
Jews converted through its influence is incredibly small.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
For instance, we learn from the last Annual Report that only
145 "young Hebrew Christians" were presented to the
Bishop for Confirmation by the Chaplain during the ten
years of his chaplaincy, or an average of about five a year.
The annual income of the Society is £35,000!</p>

<p>I write of what I know. There are agitators in the East
End of London who could arouse a <cite>Judenhetze</cite> to-morrow by
merely holding up a finger. It is only the moderating influence
of others which restrains them. But this influence,
already strained to its utmost, will not avail for ever. If the
ceaseless immigration of Russian and Polish outcasts is not
brought to an end, there will be an anti-Jewish movement
in Whitechapel, in Leeds, and the other centres of population
affected by this evil. The irritation will develop. This
would be a great social calamity, and one above all others
to be avoided.</p>

<p>These are the principal considerations which occur to one
in writing on the subject of Jewish immigration. Again let
me repeat, in endeavouring to sift this apparently endless
influx, there need be no anti-Semitic feeling in the matter.
There is a German proverb, "Every nation has the Jew it
deserves." We have these our native-born English Jews,
of whom we are all proud. Sober, thrifty, industrious, law-abiding
and patriotic, they are a valuable and an integral
portion of our community. But with these destitute
foreigners it is widely different. They bring bound up with
them all the vices and habits generated by centuries of
oppression and degradation. Something must be done to
divert this stream before it swells into an overwhelming
flood. How long is this invasion to go on? Until Russia
has emptied half&mdash;the worst half&mdash;of her Jewish population
on our shores? The question is one for English Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
themselves. If an anti-Semitic feeling breaks out in this
country, it will be because of this Russian influx, which
apparently is being allowed to go on unchecked. What are
the wealthy and powerful English Jews doing to check it,
to focus public opinion upon it, to urge the intervention
of Parliament? Apparently nothing. Surely it is not too
much to expect that a movement for judiciously restricting
and diverting this alien influx, should have the support of
the wealthy English Jews; and this not only because of
their poor co-religionists who come here to find only fresh
misery awaiting them, but also in gratitude to the country
under whose enlightened rule they have amassed their
wealth, and attained their present influence. There is
another reason also for urgency. No one who has had any
practical experience in this matter can be blind to the
growing dislike and antagonism with which these destitute
immigrants are viewed by the native working population
with whom they come in contact. This feeling is gathering
in intensity day by day.</p>

<p>An outbreak of this nature would be a disgrace and a
reproach to our vaunted civilization, and it would be almost
certain to be followed by that most dangerous phase of
popular excitement&mdash;panic legislation. Surely it would be
wiser statesmanship to do something now, while the matter
can be considered reasonably and dispassionately, than to
wait until the smouldering embers of discontent burst into a
blaze, the flames of which it may be difficult to check.</p>

<br />ITALIAN IMMIGRATION.</h2>


<p>Presiding at the annual meeting of the "Society of
Friends of Foreigners in Distress," which was held in April
last (1891), Count Deym, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador,
stated that "the charity was founded as far back as 1806,
and that the necessity for it had now increased a hundredfold.
During the past year the Society paid £2151 to 285
poor foreigners, in regular instalments of from two and
sixpence per week to five shillings per month, and £1357
in casual relief to 4264 persons of almost all nationalities."
This is only one of the many similar societies existing in
London for the aid and relief of poor and destitute foreigners&mdash;other
than those which are exclusively Jewish. Such
Societies are the Société Française de Bienfaisance à
Londres, Société Belge de Bienfaisance à Londres, the
German Society of Benevolence, which relieves Germans,
Austrians, and even Russians; and the Italian Benevolent
Society. It is unnecessary to enter into detailed statistics
as to the amount of money expended yearly by the different
Societies, or the number of members relieved; but some idea
of the extent of their operation may be gathered by the
fact that over £1100 was expended last year by the Italian
Benevolent Society alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Of late years the immigration of Italians has increased
to an alarming extent. London and our large provincial
cities are crowded with a class of Italians who are for the
most part non-producers. The Italians were amongst the
earliest immigrants here, and in many respects they are the
most undesirable. In this condemnation, I do not of course
include those Italians who upon arriving in England take
up some definite trade or employment, and who are skilled
labourers, and industrious, law-abiding citizens. Unfortunately
the great bulk of Italian immigrants differ widely
from such as these; they are, for the most part, the idle,
the vicious, and the destitute, who come here simply to
pursue that nefarious course of vagrancy and begging which
is now so rigidly forbidden in their native land. They bring
with them slothful and degraded habits, and where they congregate
to any extent, their influence upon our own people
cannot fail to be otherwise than injurious.</p>

<p>Many of them arrive here absolutely destitute, and go at
once to the Italian Consulate and beg for alms, or ask how
to be put in the way of begging. The Consulate does
everything in its power to discourage these people from
coming to England, but they come all the same. Some of
them are trained professional beggars, versed in every trick
and dodge of the trade of mendicancy. Others are socialists
and revolutionists of the worst type, who endeavour to use
the liberty enjoyed by them here, in forming secret revolutionary
societies, and in preaching the most dangerous
doctrines. They work so secretly that few have any
knowledge of their real influence and numbers. I am
informed by an Italian gentleman, whose name I am not at
liberty to give, but who has exceptional opportunities of
proving the truth of his statements, that the increase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
foreign and secret revolutionary societies in the Metropolis
has recently been very great. The same authority writes
to me in a recent letter:&mdash;"There is a large influx of destitute
Italians going on: there is no work for them to do here,
and they will not return home.... I believe there is a
real danger in allowing aliens of all nationalities to arrive so
freely in such conditions, while not socialism but anarchy
is now preached in the open streets of the quarters especially
resorted to by them. The result will be some serious
trouble very soon, especially in winter."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> These are not the
careless words of a superficial observer, but the deliberately
expressed opinion of one who holds an official position, and
has intimate knowledge of the facts. With the object lesson
which the recent Italian riots in the United States has
presented to us, there can be little doubt that in the rapid
increase of these revolutionary societies of indigent foreigners
lurk the elements of a very grave political and social
danger.</p>

<p>Thus we seem to have drifted into a position somewhat
analogous to that of Rome in the closing days of her
Empire. Juvenal in the second of his <cite>Satires</cite> complained
that Rome had become a sink for the vices and iniquity of
the known world. Johnson imitated this <cite>Satire</cite> in the
following vigorous lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">"London, the needy villain's general home,</div>
<div class="verse">The common sewer of Paris and of Rome;</div>
<div class="verse">Condemned by fortune and resistless fate,</div>
<div class="verse">Sucks in the dregs of each corrupted state."</div>
</div>

<p>Juvenal was not alone in his complaint. Horace had
said somewhat the same thing before. The Satirists had
certainly ample opportunities of observing the facts. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Rome was newly founded it was desirable and even necessary
to encourage immigration, because citizens and soldiers
were sorely needed to defend the infant State. But when
Rome had advanced to the height of her Imperial power,
the immense influx of foreigners attracted to the Eternal
City by her wealth and by her luxury, was most calamitous.
The native population of Rome were reduced to permanent
pauperism, or were driven away to the colonies. The
yeomanry of Italy disappeared; they took service in the
Legions, and were sent away to distant settlements, their
place in Rome being taken by large bodies of imported
slaves, who brought with them all the habits and vices
generated by long centuries of oppression and wrong.
"The salvation of a country lies in its middle class." Such
was the wise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictum</i> of Aristotle; but in the latter days of
the Roman Empire the middle class was wanting. How
fatal was this, is clearly seen by the different powers of
resistance that Rome exhibited at different periods of her
history. Under the Republic, when the middle class was
dominant, though Italy was several times invaded, the
native population always proved too strong for the invaders.
When under the latter days of the Empire the middle class
was wanting, and there was nothing but fabulous wealth
and prodigal luxury on the one hand, and abject poverty
and consequent misery on the other, the heart of the State
became corrupt; and as soon as the Barbarians had broken
through the cordon of Legions at the frontier, the mighty
Roman Empire sank to rise no more.</p>

<p>Historical parallels are often misleading, and this analogy,
like other analogies, may of course be carried too far; but
it is in some respects a close one. When Rome in the
height of her Imperial splendour welcomed all nationalities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
who ministered to her profligacy and luxury, it was a sign of
the canker which in time ate away the heart of the Empire.
So too, England in the Victorian era&mdash;an era of prosperity
unequalled even by Imperial Rome&mdash;throws open wide her
arms to receive the destitute, the criminal, and the worthless
of other lands, heedless of the injury which the influx of
such a class must work upon her own community, and
forgetful that the first duty of the State is towards its own
people.</p>

<p>The saddest aspect of this question of Italian immigration
is the traffic in Italian children, which has been for so
long carried on in this country under the auspices of the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i>, and which continues to flourish despite all the
efforts which have been made to check it. "Child-slavery
in England" it has been called; and certainly the condition
of these poor children is in many respects little better than
that of slaves. I have spoken and written so much about
this matter,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that there is little now left to be said; still, in
spite of laying myself open to the charge of repeating an
oft-told tale, I must needs allude to it once more, since
no treatise upon Italian immigration would be otherwise
complete.</p>

<p>The traffic is carried on in this wise:&mdash;The children are
brought over from Italy by men who obtain them from their
parents upon payment of a very small sum; for a few
ducats annually (a ducat equals 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>), and upon undertaking
to clothe and feed them. The parents who thus
dispose of their children are for the most part poor peasants
living in Calabria, and the south of Italy. Sometimes the
parents will bring the children to England themselves, and
sometimes they are confided to relations; but often it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
traffic, and they sell their children into what is a veritable
slavery without troubling about their future, and glad to be
relieved of the responsibility and expense of their maintenance
and education. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i>&mdash;that is the masters&mdash;having
thus gained possession of the children, they bring
them to England. Some travel by railway, but many of
them actually journey on foot, walking from town to town,
village to village, all the way up to Dieppe or Calais, and
from thence crossing over to our shores.</p>

<p>The children are imported here simply for the purpose of
following one or the other of the vagrant professions in the
streets of London and throughout the country. They are
sent out early in the morning with an accordion, concertina,
or other instrument, and told to sing or play before houses,
and then to wait for money. As a rule they do not openly
beg for alms, as this would bring them within the reach of
law; but they just stand and wait, and benevolent persons,
attracted by their picturesque appearance, are moved to
compassion, and give them money, ignorant or forgetful of
the fact that this money benefits them personally not at all,
but the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i> whose property they are.</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i> are often very severe, and treat the children
just like slaves. If they do not bring home a sufficient sum
they are cruelly beaten and ill-treated, kept without food or
nourishment, and sent hungry to bed. Very often these
poor children do not get home from their weary rounds
until past midnight, and they are often found utterly worn
out, and fast asleep under an archway or upon a doorstep.
They are wretchedly lodged, huddled together, four or five
sleeping in a bed when they have one to sleep in at all;
and being private houses, their lodgings are not in any way
open to inspection or improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The traffic is most lucrative, and the gains the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i>
make out of these children are very large&mdash;so much so
indeed, that after a few years they are able to retire to Italy
and to live as country gentlemen afterwards. Sometimes a
child will bring home as much as 10<i>s.</i> or more a day; and
as often one <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i> has as many as fifty children under his
care, spread about in companies in London and in the
country under the supervision of his confederates, it will be
seen that the total amount of a number of small sums
accumulating daily must be very large. Of course sometimes
the children bring home very little, and sometimes
nothing at all; but the penalty in this case is to be beaten
and kept without food, so fear stimulates their efforts, and
they do not often return quite empty-handed.</p>

<p>The effects of this evil system upon its victims is necessarily
very bad. They do not go to school, they become
very idle, and begin early to drink, smoke, and take all
kinds of vices. They grow up immoral, illiterate, vicious,
and low; a degraded class, exercising a most undesirable
influence among the surrounding population. The girls
especially all go to the bad, because they are sent into low
drinking-shops, public-houses, and similar places. When
they grow up, they all become beggars and vagrants by
profession, and always remain so, for they have learned no
other trade, and many can neither read nor write. Some
remain in England, but many go over to Italy, and bring
over children themselves. Sometimes, when they are seventeen
or eighteen years old, they run away from the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i>
and set up on their own account.</p>

<p>Many efforts have been made to put a stop to this
disgraceful traffic; but hitherto everything seems to have
fallen short of the mark. The Italian Benevolent Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
has been untiring in its efforts to stop the trade. So long
ago as 1876 the Society went on a deputation to the London
School Board, with the result that it was decided to
compel these children to go to school in the same way as
if they had been English children. But the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i> was
equal to the occasion. He removed his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">troupe</i> from Saffron
Hill, to the outlying districts of Deptford, Greenwich, and
Hammersmith. There the School Board takes no action,
and there the children dwell in large numbers, free to ply
their trade, and secure from compulsory education. The
Children's Protection Act was also another step in the right
direction, and it has certainly ameliorated the state of
affairs; but for various reasons, chiefly because the limit
of age is rather too low, it does not seem to go to the root
of the evil.</p>

<p>Several suggestions to remedy this state of affairs have
been made, all worthy of consideration. One is that there
should be a tightening of the compulsory action of the
School Boards all over the country. It is illogical that
these children should be compelled to go to school in
London, and in the country allowed to roam where they
please. Doubtless this would have a very good effect, and
the gains of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i> would be sensibly diminished.
Another suggestion is, to increase the limit of age laid down
in the Children's Protection Act to eighteen years of age
in the case of persons of both sexes, thus bringing the Act
into accord with a drastic law which was passed in Italy
in 1873,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and which has been found very effectual there.
This course, however, is obviously open to objection, since
it might press hardly upon individual cases. The most
effectual remedy would be to adopt the plan followed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
America, namely, to stop these children at the port of
arrival, and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i>, and send them all back at once
to their own country. In all European countries they are
expelled, or refused admission. Such a course, however,
would require a special law, and that necessarily will be
some time in coming. The question is:&mdash;what is to be done
in the meantime? That the evil still continues to flourish
there can be no manner of doubt. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i> do not
confine their attentions only to children, but frequently
bring over whole families as well. A case came to light in
Birmingham this year,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i> named Delicato, who
had brought over an Italian family&mdash;a father, a mother, and
two daughters. At the end of two years the record of
that unfortunate family was as follows:&mdash;The father was paid
£2 for two years' work and discharged; the mother had
previously been sent back to Italy, because from ill-health
she had become practically useless to her master. One of
the daughters Delicato had seduced, and she is still living
with him; the other daughter ran away and married, and
her husband brought an action to recover her earnings.
When the case came before the Court, the whole transaction
was exposed. Inquiries were also instituted as to the
antecedents of Delicato, and it was found that he had been
carrying on this nefarious trade for years, and had three
separate establishments in different parts of the country.
It was found that this man had seduced no less than three
young girls who had been committed to his care, and then
abandoned them. This is no uncommon occurrence, for
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i> are men utterly without principle, and thoroughly
bad in every way.</p>

<p>The parents are almost as bad as the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i>, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
following instance will show:&mdash;An Italian named Mancini
was recently<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> charged before the Bow Street Police Court
for causing a child to solicit alms. It was a case of heartless
cruelty. The little girl, his daughter, was engaged in dragging
a heavy barrel-organ about the streets. At intervals she
stopped and turned the handle, her father meanwhile standing
a little way off to see what coppers she obtained. It
was raining at the time the man was taken in charge, and
the child's boots were saturated with water, and her clothes
literally drenched. She was only nine years of age.
Another instance of the rapacity of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i> is illustrated
by the following case, of even more recent date.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> A young
ice-cream vendor named Romano brought an action against
his master, Auguste Pampa, at the Brompton County Court,
for the recovery of four months' wages. It appeared that
Romano had arrived in this country in a state of absolute
destitution. Pampa, a compatriot, agreed to give him work,
and an agreement was drawn up between them. It set
forth that Pampa engaged Romano for one year to sell
ice-cream in the streets of London; that he should be paid
£1 2<i>s.</i> a month, and that Pampa should board and lodge
him, and provide him with clothes. The plaintiff said that
the defendant used to send him out in rags in all sorts of
weather, and that he literally had no clothes to cover him.
The judge gave a verdict for the plaintiff. The case throws
a strong light upon the fate of Italian immigrants in London,
and upon the class of Italians who come here.</p>

<p>The best way to put down this infamous traffic, in default
of restrictive legislation, is undoubtedly to lose no opportunities
of bringing the painful facts before the public. If
once the charitable public could be made to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
that the money they give to those little ones benefits them
personally not at all, but goes to swell the gains of the
rapacious <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i>, who laughs and grows rich upon the
sufferings of his victims, the supplies would be cut off at
their source, and the dream of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i> to return to
sunny Italy and live there as a country gentleman, vanish
for ever.</p>

<p>Few have any conception of the extent or nature of
Italian immigration. Signor Righetti, the Secretary of the
Italian Benevolent Society, estimates the number of Italians
in London alone at upwards of 9000. In this estimate
his opinion is corroborated by Signor Roncoroni, Secretary
of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Societá dei Cuochi e Camerieri</i>, who states that out
of this 9000, 2000 are employed as Italian cooks and
waiters in London. These of course can in no sense be
objected to, because they are skilled labourers. Of the
remaining 7000, the vast majority are either organ-grinders
or ice-cream vendors. The head-quarters of the organ-grinders
is&mdash;or was&mdash;at Eyre Street Hill, a steep and
narrow thoroughfare forming a connecting link between
Leather Lane and Coppice Row in Clerkenwell. There are
a few minor settlements in Kensington, another in Notting
Hill, a third in Somers Town; but the principal foreign
colony is situated at Eyre Street Hill. Eyre Street Hill
has tortuous ins and outs, and numerous blind alleys, in
each and all of which Italians swarm.</p>

<p>The Italian ice-cream barrow has become as familiar
a picture in London street-trading as the apple-stall, baked
chestnuts, or baked potato stove. The profits derived from
the sale of this unwholesome compound are said to be very
satisfactory; and certainly the quantity manufactured must
be enormous. There is a depôt for ice on Eyre Street Hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
All day long, during the summer months, may be seen there
waggon-loads of ice-cubes, which are afterwards broken up
for the purpose required. Also the vendor of lemons
does a brisk business in the same locality, and likewise the
milkman&mdash;or rather, I should say, the man who sells what
passes for milk. The ingredients of the ice-cream may
possibly be found harmless enough; but the way in which
the compound is prepared is in the last degree objectionable.
The manufacture is often carried on in the living-room of
the family, the condition of which is filthy and disgusting
in the extreme. Near Leather Lane there is one short
street of high black houses, the windows of which are
patched and plugged with paper and rags. The passages
and stairs are dilapidated and filthy, and the sanitary conditions
simply abominable. In almost every room of each
of these houses, resides at least one ice-cream maker, and
vendor. Such a room will serve as a living and sleeping
room for a whole family&mdash;the man, his wife, and a numerous
progeny.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this foreign colony work all the week
with their ice-barrows or their barrel-organs, but Saturday
evening is, with them, a time of relaxation and pastime.
With the natives of the sunny South, not to enjoy is not to
live; and though I do not include in the numbers of those
who amuse themselves, the miserable little victims of the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padroni</i>, the comparatively well-to-do Italians always go in
for amusing themselves as soon as they can afford it.
Dancing is the chief pastime of these people. On Saturday
nights they regularly assemble together for this purpose, the
women arrayed in the picturesque attire of their native
country, and the men in their holiday garments likewise.
As I have never been to one, I cannot say how these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
gatherings are conducted. They are not carried on in
licensed premises, but in the cellars and kitchens of private
houses, where admission to strangers is denied. Probably
they are harmless enough. One thing is tolerably certain,
refreshments are not supplied on the premises. There are
plenty of public-houses hard by; and an observant person
standing in the bar of one of them while the dancing is
going on in an adjoining house, will note from time to time
a sudden inrush of several couples still flushed and panting
from the Terpsichorean exercise in which they have been
indulging; who after a hearty draught of something in a
pewter pot will rush off, and dance away again. On Saturday
night the tap-rooms of the taverns in the vicinity of Saffron
Hill are well filled; and brisk business is done in drinkables.
The company, however, is not exclusively Italian;
there being a goodly number of Irish besides.</p>

<p>The Italians are credited as a race with having a sensitive
ear for music. One can only say that those of their
countrymen who come over here and inflict upon us the
ear-torturing melodies of their barrel-organs and accordions
sadly belie the reputation of their country. When once
asked in the House of Commons if he could do anything to
put down this nuisance, Mr. Goschen replied that it was a
difficult matter, inasmuch as many derived great pleasure
from the music of the barrel-organ. Such an answer leads
one to suppose that Mr. Goschen has not such a keen ear
for music as he has an eye to finance, and also that he is
ignorant of the true facts.</p>

<p>Even on a superficial aspect the nuisance is intolerable;
but that is the least part of the evil. When we come to
look beneath the surface of the seemingly careless existence
of these Italian street musicians, and see the cruelty, hardships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and injustice which is undoubtedly bound up with the
system, we shall recognize that it is high time that something
was done to put down what is not only an intolerable
nuisance, but also an evil trade.</p>

<p>For a nation which was foremost in abolishing the slave-trade,
to tamely tolerate in its midst an inhuman traffic like
this, is something worse than an anachronism&mdash;it is a disgrace,
and a reproach upon our vaunted civilization.</p>

<h2 class="title"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a>
<br />ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS.</h2>


<p>The economic aspect of this many-sided question is undoubtedly
one of the gravest and most worthy of consideration.
The unlimited influx of cheap, destitute, foreign
labour, cannot but exercise a prejudicial effect upon the
wages of the native working-classes. It forces the decent
British workman to compete on unequal terms with those
who are willing to work for any wage&mdash;however meagre&mdash;for
any number of hours, and amid surroundings filthy and
disgusting in the extreme. I do not of course say that it
has this effect upon wages in all industries, but only in those
trades which the evil has yet reached. These are not great
trades, perhaps, in the sense of the textile or metal industries,
but they are considerable industries all the same,
and they give employment to hundreds of thousands of men
and women.</p>

<p>In the trades and districts chiefly affected, this is the
agency which reduces the price of labour to a level below
that upon which Englishmen and Englishwomen can with
decency and self-respect exist, and which renders effectual
combination impossible. Every one with any practical
knowledge of business, will admit that it is the lowest price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which rules the market. If then we have a body of men
combining together for the purpose of getting what they
consider to be a fair wage, how can they maintain that
combination, if, when a strike occurs, or any little dispute
arises between employer and employed, by which the
employed hope to get a little better terms for themselves, the
destitute foreigner steps in ready to undersell them, and to
work for little or next to nothing at all? Nor, as things
stand, can the employers be greatly blamed either. In
these trades few of them are great capitalists, the battle of
life is pretty hard on them too, and in struggling to better
themselves, they naturally seize every legal means that
offers.</p>

<p>One of the worst features of this system is the "multiplication
of small masters." The subject is a tempting one,
but space forbids me to dwell on it. I would only say that
the competition among these small employers is almost as
fierce as the competition among the employed. Much
indignation has been directed against the "sweater," the
bloated human spider, who, according to <cite>Alton Locke</cite>, sucks
the life-blood of his victims, or who more recently has been
presented to us in the pages of <cite>Punch</cite> as a gorgeously-apparelled,
champagne-drinking, cigar-smoking Hebrew,
who, as he rakes in his gold, laughs and grows fat upon
the sufferings of the wretched creatures sacrificed to his
greed.</p>

<p>Such monsters do exist. Of that there can be no doubt.
They are by no means exclusively Hebrews, neither are
they confined to the tailoring trade alone; nor is it necessary
to go as far as Whitechapel in search of them. But a
dispassionate study of the facts will show that the great bulk
of the "sweaters" are very poor; and that with their profits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
driven down by competition, they can hardly make a living.
In fact, both employers and employed are alike the victims
of this fierce competitive struggle, and of the craze for
cheapness at any cost. The result is that the market is
flooded with a quantity of cheap and inferior articles which
injure the trade, and destroy the demand for good English
work.</p>

<p>At present, the two trades most affected are the cheap
tailoring and boot-making. In the former, as a direct
consequence, all the horrors of "sweating" reign supreme.
In the latter, the cheaper kind of work is now taken by
foreigners entirely; hundreds of Englishmen who were
formerly employed in it at a fair wage are driven out of
employment, and now seek in vain for work. "Oh," but I
hear some say, "they can turn their hands to something
else." But it is not so easy for a man who has been
apprenticed and brought up to a certain trade, to turn
his hand to "something else." His craft is his bread, his
trade is his capital; it is dear to him, for upon it he has
lavished all his skill, all his energies. It is hard that he
should be robbed of it by the foreigner. These two trades
are not the only ones affected. In the cabinet-making,
chair-turning, cigar-making, cheap fur trade, and other
industries, the same evil is beginning to work, and always
with similar baleful results. Labour is displaced; Englishmen
are robbed of their work; and if they do not become
paupers or something worse, they are driven from their
homes to seek their fortunes anew in some distant land.</p>

<p>The evil effect of this unchecked immigration upon the
price of labour is very marked. I have collected together a
few articles made by "sweated" workpeople in the East
End, and have traced out the cost of labour in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
instance. These samples include a wooden "Windsor"
chair, solidly put together, and neatly turned; it was sold
for 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, and the price paid for making it was 2-1/2<i>d.</i> A
fur collarette of hareskin, dyed gray and lined&mdash;really a very
decent-looking article&mdash;was sold for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; labour received,
1-3/4<i>d.</i> A pair of button boots, leather-lined throughout,
were bought for 3<i>s.</i> 11-1/2<i>d.</i>; labour received 2-1/2<i>d.</i> for the
"lasting" (<i>i.e.</i> sewing, heeling, and putting together); this
2-1/2<i>d.</i> did not include nails, wax, thread, all necessary to the
work, which had to be found by the workman. Three pairs
of boots can be "lasted" in an hour. There is also the
"finishing," which costs 2<i>d.</i>, and five pairs can be "finished"
in an hour. But the most striking instance of all is that of
a knickerbocker suit, well-made, and properly adorned with
braid, made by a "sweated" workwoman in the East End.
It was bought at a shop for 2<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, and the woman received
for making it 5-1/2<i>d.</i>; which wretched pittance did not
include needles, thread, and material used in the binding,
all of which had to be found by the person "sweated."
Now, I put it fairly and dispassionately to any unprejudiced
person, if honest labour has no better reward to offer than
this, what wonder if thousands of our people, in despair
of earning a decent livelihood, are driven into vice and
degradation&mdash;the men to drink, the women to prostitution?</p>

<p>Much has been said and written about the exact number
of these alien immigrants, which, as has already been
pointed out, in the present dearth of trustworthy statistics,
cannot be accurately ascertained. It is not merely a
question of numbers. I submit that it matters comparatively
little to the main argument whether the arrivals in one
particular year were a few thousands more or a few thousands
less, or the precise numbers of "those who return again to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the Continent," when there are already so many of these indigent
foreigners in our midst. Even supposing for the sake
of argument&mdash;I do not for one moment admit it&mdash;that the
numbers arriving are comparatively small, they would still
have a very bad effect upon the price of wages, in the
trades and industries upon which they entered. The inflow
of a comparatively small number into a neighbourhood
where much of the work is low-skilled and irregular, will
often produce an effect which seems quite out of proportion
to the actual number of the invaders. From the native
labourer's point of view, the mere fact of the presence of
these low-living foreigners, ready as they are at any moment
to step in and undersell his labour, constitutes a standing
menace to his interests. In all the trades in which they are
employed, the rate of wages is being perpetually beaten
down.</p>

<p>Thus it follows that any argument drawn from the number
of these destitute aliens, as compared with the total population
of the United Kingdom, is obviously wide of the mark.
We must consider their distribution in particular localities
and particular trades; more than that, in order to arrive at
any valuable result, we must examine also into the local and
trade distribution of foreign labour <em>conjointly</em>.</p>

<p>In this connection the evidence comes almost entirely
from the East End of London. As we have seen, the two
trades principally affected are the cheap tailoring and boot-making.
Let us consider the latter first.</p>

<p>Mr. Freak, Secretary of the Shoemakers' Society, stated
before the Immigration Committee, that over 10,000
foreigners were engaged in the boot-making trade in the
East End of London. He said:&mdash;"Until within ten or
fifteen years ago, the Jew foreigners did not affect our trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
much; but by degrees they have taken the work that men
generally learned their trade on, such as the commoner
class of work. They simply have taken it to themselves
entirely, and the effect has been that hundreds of our men
have to walk about, particularly in winter-time, who used to
be employed on that class of work. These Jew foreigners
work in our trade at this common work sixteen or eighteen
hours a day, and the consequence is, they make a lot of
cheap nasty stuff that destroys the market, and injures
us. And if we have a strike on, or any little dispute
occurs in our trade, when we might otherwise get a little
better terms for ourselves, they go and take the work at
any price, and so defeat our ends in getting or attempting
to get our proper wages." Mr. Freak reckons that about
25 per cent. of the persons engaged in the <em>whole</em> of the
boot and shoe trade in the city of London are foreigners;
but that the commoner kind of work is monopolized by
foreigners entirely. He further said that the introduction
of this pauper labour has seriously affected the rate of wages
received by the English operatives, not of course so much
in the best shops, but very greatly in the commoner class of
work. It had also the effect of reducing the employment of
a large number of Englishmen, and of driving hundreds out
of work altogether. He went on to say:&mdash;"I know that at
the time when I first came to London, any one could get
work at the middle or common class of goods; and now
they are sent out to the homes or given to the sweaters,
who take them on the system that they are working themselves
in the way I have mentioned; and the price is
reduced so low that to work single-handed a man could not
get his living. He has to sweat his children or his wife;
and if a man and his wife and children do not want anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
more than just bread and cheese and sleep, then they might
get a living out of it; because some of these Jews who
come over will not come out of the house for a whole week.
They will sleep in the same place where they work day after
day. They simply get food and the barest raiment to
cover them, and that is all they can get for their work. I
do not think that these foreign Jews have created any new
industry; but they have made the industry in common work
more beastly, and I do think that they are doing an injury
in our foreign markets by the stuff that they make, because
a great quantity of it is made of cardboard and composition.
The leather that is put into the sole is simply a bit of veneer.
It is simply a thin sole covered over a composition&mdash;clump
as we call it. It is composed of shreds of leather, ground
up, and stuck together."</p>

<p>Now let us consider the cheap tailoring trade in the East
End. It appears, upon the evidence of Dr. Ogle, whose
work it is to prepare the statistical part of the Census, and
whose opinion upon all such matters stands deservedly
high, that of the persons engaged in the tailoring trade, in
the parish of St. George's-in-the-East, over 80 per cent.
are foreigners. Mr. Zeitlin, Secretary of the Jews' branch of
the Tailors' Association, himself a Russian Jew, stated before
the same Committee that there were altogether employed in
the East End of London about 25,000 tailors, of whom
10,000 are men and 15,000 women. Out of the 10,000
men, "mostly foreigners and not born here," three-parts are
Jewish, and one part not Jewish; and of the women three-parts
are English, and one part Jewesses.</p>

<p>Mr. John Burnett, Labour Correspondent of the Board of
Trade, who was specially deputed in August 1887 to make
inquiries into the Sweating system in the East End of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
London, reported that matters were much worse there of
late years, because of the "enormous influx of pauper
foreigners." He made a rough calculation that of some
20,000 tailors in the East End of London, 15,000 were
foreigners&mdash;that is, persons not born in England; and of the
remaining 5000, nearly all were Jews born in England, who
might almost be described as foreigners also, since in their
habits and their customs they have nothing in common with
the native community. He stated that there were not more
than 250 Englishmen employed in the cheap tailoring trade
in the whole East End of London. They have all been
driven out by Jews. There is, however, still a considerable
employment of Englishwomen. Mr. Burnett also drafted a
memorandum on the immigration of foreigners, and in it he
stated that in respect of the trades and districts chiefly
affected by it, the evil had assumed serious aspects. He
considered that London, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester,
Newcastle-on-Tyne, Glasgow&mdash;to some extent Edinburgh,
and also some other Scotch towns&mdash;were affected by the
evil. There is of course the general lack of actual statistics
as to the precise amount of the foreign population in these
towns; but the Glasgow Trades' Council, for instance,
though it has no specific information to hand on the
subject, states generally that the tailoring in that city
is overrun by Polish Jews. Mr. Burnett contemplates the
time when the ready-made clothing trade will be entirely in
foreign hands.</p>

<p>The presence of foreign immigration is felt also, though
to a lesser extent, in cabinet-making and other trades. In the
cabinet-making trade, Mr. Burnett estimates that of 23,000
persons engaged in it in London, 4000 are foreigners,
chiefly Germans, and many of them German, Russian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Polish Jews. He draws a distinction between the Germans
pure and simple, and the German, Russian, and Polish Jews,
for this reason. The Germans are found in the superior
workshops of the West End, and they are found receiving
the same rate of wages as their English shop-mates; but in
the cases of the Russian and Polish Jews at the East End,
they are receiving a much lower rate when they are employed,
and they are employed on inferior work under entirely
different conditions.</p>

<p>The foregoing considerations make it clear that the effect
of foreign immigration upon the condition of our own workmen
is not to be measured by the small percentage foreigners
bear to the general population of the United Kingdom; but
by their distribution in the particular trades of particular
localities.</p>

<p>It is impossible to deny the displacing power of so large
an addition to labour, in trades already overcrowded. The
fact that under such circumstances the new-comers find
employment, infers of necessity the displacement of labour
previously employed. It implies also the denial of employment
to natives anxious to obtain it. Nor is this large
intrusion of a foreign element confined in its effects to the
displacement of native labour alone. It brings down to its
own level labour that is not displaced. In all trades that
do not require long apprenticeship and technical skill, the
supply of labour is greatly in excess of the demand. Competition
to obtain employment is in consequence cruelly
severe. The inevitable results are, the evasion of the law
respecting factories and workshops, the reduction of wages
to the lowest minimum, and the extension of the hours of
work to the utmost limits of human endurance.</p>

<p>The effect of foreign immigration upon our labouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
population is far greater than might at first be supposed.
Its inevitable effect is the degradation of all the native
labour employed, to the level of the foreign labour which is
brought into competition with it. When the struggle is
between those accustomed to a higher, and those accustomed
to a lower standard of life, the latter can obviously
oust the former and take their work. Just as a base
currency drives out of circulation a pure currency, so does
a lower standard of comfort drive out a higher one.</p>

<p>What do competent authorities say on the subject of
native labour?</p>

<p>Mr. Goodman, who was a member of the Executive
Committee of the Liverpool Tailors' Society, stated in his
evidence before the House of Lords' Committee, that fifteen
years ago the Sweating system only existed to a very limited
extent in Liverpool; but that now it was carried on in
a most extensive manner. He said that he accounted
for its existence to a very large extent by the influx of
foreigners, principally Jews. "At the present moment,
fully two-thirds of the sweaters in Liverpool are foreigners;
the majority of whom, as I have already stated, are not
tailors at all, and have never served one hour in the tailor
trade properly as an apprentice. I was told by a Jew some
time ago, and he made a serious complaint to me on that
head, that he was already finding the competition of his
own people so severe, that being a practical man, he should
have to do as they had done in many cases, lower his
prices, or else he could not make a living. The competition,
even amongst the Jews, is getting so severe that
the prices are constantly tending to decrease; and I believe
that to-day they are very much lower than they were a few
years ago in Liverpool, through this competition of foreigners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
amongst themselves, together with their competition with
the natives."</p>

<p>Mr. Allen, Secretary of the Master Tailors' Association in
Liverpool, stated that, "As an Association, we have discussed
the matter, and we are opposed to it in the main (<i>i.e.</i>
foreign immigration), and we passed a resolution that the
importation of pauper aliens be prohibited with this condition,
the prohibition not to extend to skilled workmen
imported under contract."</p>

<p>Mr. Keir, General Secretary of the Amalgamated Society
of Tailors, thus moderately and dispassionately stated the
case:&mdash;"I hardly know that it would be wise to stop immigration
altogether. That would be an unnatural and hardly
fair way of doing the thing; but I think it ought to be regulated
in some way, and that the poorest, and most miserable,
and the unskilled, perhaps, of foreign labour ought not to be
thrown upon the markets of England to oppose and to act
detrimentally to the interests of the English people. I do
not think it would be wise, and I don't know that we could
advocate, and I am sure any intelligent man would not
advocate altogether, the complete prohibition of foreign
labour; but at the same time I think there must be, or
ought to be, some means devised whereby skilled labour
should contend against skilled labour in a fair and straight
market. It is not skilled labour against skilled labour; it is
poverty thrown in our midst, and it is poverty competing
with itself, as it were; and struggling in that way, and the
manner in which they live, the food they eat, and the circumstances
under which they exist, deprive them altogether
of the comforts of home, you may almost say, as far as
Englishmen, Scotchmen, or Welshmen are concerned."</p>

<p>One point remains to be noted. It has been urged that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
these immigrant aliens do not enter upon native trades, but
introduce new industries of their own. If that were really
the case, such a contention would undoubtedly have much
weight. The Huguenots established new industries of silk,
glass, and paper; the Flemings introduced the finer class
of weaving into England; in both of these cases the alien
influx was beneficial. But it cannot be seriously maintained
that these low-class Jewish immigrants have stimulated or
created new wants. They have created no new trade; they
have debased old ones. I admit that they almost monopolize
the cheap clothing trade, but even here they have
created no new <em>kind</em> of industry.</p>

<p>The power of the German, Russian, or Polish Jew,
accustomed to a lower standard of life, to undersell the
English worker in the English labour market must be
admitted by all, though the exact importance of it is, I
know, a disputed point. The industrial degradation of the
"sweated" workers arises from the fact that they are working
surrounded by a "pool of unemployed," or superfluous
supply of labour. So long as this standing pool remains,
and so long as it is ever being augmented by the endless
influx of cheap, destitute foreign labour, so long it is difficult
to see how the wages of the low unskilled workers can be
materially raised. Let the pool be gradually drawn off, and
wages will rise, since the combined action of the workers
will no longer be able to be defeated by the eagerness of the
foreigner to take their work and wages. But the pool can
never be drawn off until the stream which so largely recruits
it is cut off at its source. If once this foreign influx is stopped,
it will decrease by the natural process of evaporation.</p>

<p>Let us take a national view. The true standard of a
nation's prosperity is to be found in the prosperity of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
working-classes. The higher the rate of wages the better
is the condition of the working-classes; the cheaper the
labour of a country, the lower the condition of the people
therein. One of the surest signs of the real rise of a nation
is the elevation of the masses in their wages, their habits,
their homes, their scale of living, and their condition generally.
Anything which tends to reduce the price of labour
tends also to reduce the labourer's standard of comfort and
prosperity, and there can be no manner of doubt that this
continuous influx of destitute foreigners does tend both
directly and indirectly to reduce the profits of the wage-earning
classes. Wages follow certain inexorable laws of
supply and demand. If the supply of human labour exceeds
the market demand, then the men will be beaten down; and
how can the supply do otherwise than exceed the demand,
when the market is being continually flooded by the influx
of the cheapest kind of foreign labour?</p>

<p>"Unrestricted immigration," said a witness before the
United States Committee, "is the degradation of American
labour." If that be true in a country of such enormous
resources as the United States, how much more true must
it be in our own densely-populated little island? It is the
high rate of wages which has given to the American workmen
their unexampled prosperity as citizens. It is the
recognition of this truth which has induced the United
States Government to guard its doors so jealously against
the entrance of the destitute and unfit of other lands. And
they are right, not only on economic grounds, but for other
reasons as well, since all history teaches us that in the long
run degraded labour is sure to avenge itself upon all
the classes above it.</p>

<p>"Rely upon yourselves; by societies, combinations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
well-directed strikes, you can secure higher wages and better
conditions for yourselves." Such are the words of the
"old" Trades Unionism, and in the main they are true
enough. But in this instance they fall beside the mark; for,
as I have already pointed out, combination is rendered impossible
by this fierce competition of destitute labour from
abroad. In the industries affected, any man or woman, or
any body of men or women, who refused to work upon the
sweating prices quoted, would be simply turned away, and
their places filled by the foreigner. They are literally living
from hand to mouth. They know that if they lose their
wage one week, they will be destitute the next, and starving
the week after. Under these circumstances it is not
surprising to find that there exists among the native
working-classes the strongest feeling against the great and
increasing invasion of their rights. This feeling is not only
confined to the trades chiefly affected, it is rapidly spreading
throughout the country. So far as I have been able to
judge, the feeling among the working-classes in favour of
restrictive measures is practically unanimous. A vast majority
of the great Trades Unions and Labour Organizations&mdash;not
only those immediately affected, but others as well&mdash;have
passed strongly-worded resolutions on the subject, recognizing
that though the evil may not yet have sensibly
affected their particular industry, yet it tends indirectly to
do so. That the labour organizations are fully alive to the
importance of this question is shown by the following letter,
taken almost at random from hundreds of similar communications
which have reached me during the last few months.
It is from the Secretary of the "National Society of Amalgamated
Brassworkers," Birmingham.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The arguments are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
so clearly and cogently put, that they are well worthy of
being quoted here.</p>

<p>"The Executive desire me to say that they are unanimously
of opinion that the time has come when the State
should regulate, in the interests of British labour, the immigration
of destitute aliens; and that they have observed with
alarm the injury done to their brethren in the East End of
London and other parts of the country by this element of
unfair competition. My Executive desire me also to say
that these conclusions are arrived at reluctantly, as they
would like this country to be a really happy England, giving
welcome to the oppressed of every land. While, however,
they hold this view strongly, they are also of opinion that
this broad principle must not be allowed, to any appreciable
extent, to be the means of pauperizing English men and
English women. The unchecked admission of this force
has spread enough misery; and it is hoped that your efforts
will bring about such restrictions as will put an end to an
evil which has been the means of providing a surplus labour
market to become a ready prey to the sweater."</p>

<p>These are weighty words. They come from an important
Society, which, though its members have not yet felt the shoe
pinch themselves, they recognize the truth of the old saying,
"If one member suffers, all the other members suffer with it."
This utterance does not stand alone; it is but an echo of
the opinion of similar organizations throughout the country.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The English workman is naturally patient and law-abiding.
It is his nature to suffer and be strong. All that he asks
for&mdash;and surely it is not an unreasonable request&mdash;is that
he should be allowed a fair field for his energies in the land
that gave him birth. If this be denied him, then, sooner or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
later, will follow consequences, which, to quote Herbert
Spencer, "no man may tell in language."</p>

<p>It is because this movement is so essentially a workingman's
movement that I am confident of its ultimate success.
Let us look the situation in the face. The balance of
power has passed into the hands of the wage-earning
classes&mdash;three-fourths of the electorate are wage-earners;
I use the word in its widest sense. Therefore, it follows
as a matter of course, that just as the land-owning classes
when they had the power made laws in their interests; and
the trading-classes when they had the power passed laws for
their interests; so the working, wage-earning classes of this
country, now that they have the power, will use it to protect
and advance their interests likewise. And what can touch
their interests more nearly than this unrestricted immigration
of destitute foreign labour? "The flowing tide is with us."
Whatever may be the immediate interests of the hour, labour
questions constitute the politics of the future. There are
signs all round the world that social problems and labour
questions are gradually taking the place of older issues over
which men have contended. There is no likelihood now of
a war about creeds, no dynastic contest is now on the
cards; the rivalries of nations and of races are not as potent
as they were; but the lot of the "dim millions," the
labouring-classes, who were ignored by all the warriors and
statesmen of the past, is now forcing its way to the front.
The contest which is gathering will not be around "exhausted
factories and obsolete policies," as Mr. Disraeli said in
1852, but living problems, coming home to the hearts and
to the firesides of all labouring men. Labour legislation is
the legislation of the future; and it needs no prophetic eye
to foresee that one of the leading measures in the labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
programme of the future will be to protect the English
working-men against this perpetual pouring in of destitute
foreigners. Hitherto in only one constituency, Lewisham,
has this question found a prominent place in an electioneering
programme. We all know the result of that election.
As it was at Lewisham, so will it be before long in every
urban constituency throughout England. "Why," the
working-classes are asking, "should we be robbed of our
birthright by the refuse population of other countries?"
Why, indeed! People are beginning to see that a great
and crying evil flourishes in our midst; and when that fact
has been thoroughly digested, means will soon be found to
remedy it.</p>

<br />WOMAN'S BITTER CRY.</h2>


<p>The woes of the East End workwomen form no new
theme. They are as old as the "Song of the Shirt"; even
older. In spite of Hood's inspired poem, which when it
appeared rang like a tocsin through the land, the miseries
of the needlewoman's lot have not only remained unalleviated,
but they have gathered in intensity as the years
rolled on. How comes it that in these days of social
politics and remedial legislation, the condition of such a
numerous body should have gone from bad to worse?
The answer is not far to seek. They have no votes; the
politician passes them by. They have no money to spend,
no time to strike, no strength to combine, the agitator
ignores them. The class for which I plead, is voiceless,
voteless, inarticulate, helpless. These poor women have
never been consulted as to whether they are content to pay
the price needed to continue the so-called "traditions" of
England with regard to the unrestricted entrance of the
refuse population of other countries. They are not likely
to be consulted, since they are powerless; no one angles
for their votes, for they have none to give. The strong
man in his strength when confronted by this alien invasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
can battle with it, or when the contest is hopeless, he can
retire before it. The world is open to him, and in other
lands beyond the seas he may find that fair field for his
energies which is denied him in the land of his birth. But
the weak woman in her weakness, what of her? She must
perforce remain to feebly fight on single-handed in the unequal
struggle; and when her weakness conquers her, when
her strength fails her, she can only lie down and die. This
is a terrible alternative, is there no other? Yes, there
is another, infinitely more terrible, infinitely more horrible&mdash;the
streets.</p>

<p>If we apply the four leading features of the "sweating"
disease&mdash;low wages, long hours, irregular employment,
unsanitary conditions&mdash;to women, we shall find that in each
case the absolute pressure is heavier upon the weaker sex.
This is not to be wondered at. Physically weaker than
men, women receive a smaller amount of work, and a lower
rate of wages, especially in unskilled labour. Combination
can do nothing for them; it does not reach them. The
mass of women-workers labour either at home or in the
small "sweating dens"; the long hours, the excessive
labour, and the under-feeding, crush out all the spirit and
strength of resistance they possess, and with them combination
is impossible.</p>

<p>But it is upon the system of "out-work" that "sweating"
thrives, and it is this "out-work" that women, more
especially married women, chiefly engage. One would
think that the very weakness of women, the duties of
maternity, the care of children, ought to secure them some
respite in this industrial struggle, but it is not so. We are
always boasting of our civilization and our Christianity,
yet these humanitarian considerations avail nothing. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the contrary, they only handicap women the more, and tell
fatally against them in the competitive battle. The commercial
competition of to-day in the cheap clothing trade,
intensified as it is by the influx of the foreigner, positively
trades upon the maternity of women-workers. These poor
creatures have no time for the pure tender delights of
motherhood; they have no opportunity of attending properly
to their children, or to the many other little duties which
gather around the English word "home." To the low-class
foreign Jew this matters little, for the word "home"
to him has no meaning at all; but to Englishmen and
to Englishwomen it offers a terrible problem. What "hope
of our race" can we expect from the feeble, half-starved,
and wholly overworked Englishwoman, who is thus thrust
into the furnace of this fierce foreign competition!</p>

<p>There is another consideration also to be faced, which
I have already hinted at. The unrestricted immigration of
destitute aliens tends directly to increase prostitution in
London and our large cities. This is a startling proposition;
let me proceed to demonstrate its truth.</p>

<p>A witness giving evidence before the Sweating Committee,
described the sweater's dens as "the most filthy, poisoning,
soul-and-body-killing places imaginable." Even to stand at
the open door of one of such places, and to breathe the
f&oelig;tid air which rushes forth, is well-nigh unendurable to
persons not hardened to such conditions. Yet it is in such
places as these that Englishwomen are compelled to work
side by side with the foreigner. To the foreigner it seems
not to matter so much; to the Englishwoman, sooner or
later, it is certain death. But I hear some say, "How
about the Factory Regulations?" In theory the Factory
Regulations are admirable; in practice they are utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
inadequate. Their provisions are constantly evaded.
Women are kept working in these dens from 6 a.m. until
8 p.m., 10 p.m., or even midnight; or the intention of the
Act is frustrated by their being given work to do at home.
A case was mentioned before the House of Lords' Committee
of a girl eighteen years of age, who worked from seven in
the morning to half-past eight at night, for wages ranging
from 3<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> a week. On Fridays she worked from 6 a.m.
to 5 p.m. (eleven hours), that being considered half a day,
and paid for accordingly. All sorts of tricks are played
to evade the Factory Inspector. His first appearance in
the street is notified all along the sweating dens by a
preconcerted signal. When he arrives at the door, he is
kept in parley for a minute or two. Meanwhile the women
and girls are smuggled away, and by the time he is admitted
there is not a woman visible. They lend themselves, poor
creatures, to this deception, because they know that if they
did not, plenty more could be found who would. The
result is that they are utterly at the sweater's mercy. Even
the time that ought to be allowed for meals is often infringed
upon. A woman who availed herself of a full hour for
dinner would be liable to instant dismissal. Even the
half-hour for tea is frequently denied them; the tea is put
down by their side, and they swallow it as they work.</p>

<p>Such is the case of women working in the sweating dens.
Those who work at home are scarcely better off. They
must, through the constant pressure of this foreign competition,
labour from dawn till late at night to procure the
barest subsistence, a subsistence not sufficient to keep them
in health and strength. One wretched garret is all they can
afford. Here they labour, and live, and die&mdash;no one heeding.
In the winter they do without fire, and often the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
workers put on their backs, for the sake of warmth, the
garments they are not actually engaged upon. Oftentimes
it is not the woman alone, but her whole family who have
to share this single room. It is impossible for a woman,
working these excessive hours, to keep the room clean;
and the consequence is that, especially in hot weather, it
becomes infested by vermin, which find their way into the
garments in process of making. The takers-in of the work
in the larger houses, it is stated, kill the worst of these
vermin with their shears as they examine their garments!</p>

<p>Few of us would consider that any sum could compensate
for such grinding toil under such awful conditions. Yet
what do these poor women get for their labour? I have
already quoted the case of a girl who earned from 3<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i>
a week for over thirteen hours a day; but many girls in the
East End factories do not earn more than 2<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> a week!
Working by the piece, a woman is paid 5<i>d.</i> for making a
vest; 7-1/2<i>d.</i> for making a coat. She can by fifteen hours'
work make four coats in a day, which comes to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
but out of this has to be deducted 3<i>d.</i> to a button-holer
for making the button-holes, and 4<i>d.</i> for "trimmings,"
which means fire, ironing, and soap, all necessary for her
work. A boy's knickerbocker suit is made at prices varying
from 4-1/2<i>d.</i> to 10-1/2<i>d.</i> complete, according to the amount of
work. For a suit made at 9<i>d.</i> the sweater gets 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, leaving
him a profit of 6<i>d.</i> Before destitute immigration set in, in
such a volume, and prices were consequently higher, such
a suit would have been sold at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, which would have
admitted of a larger profit, and consequently higher price
for labour. Other prices are&mdash;a shirt, sold in a shop for
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, is made for 1<i>s.</i>; and men's trousers are made
outright at as low a price as 4-1/2<i>d.</i> per pair. The price paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
by a sweater to a woman for machining trousers, runs from
1-1/4<i>d.</i> to 3-1/4<i>d.</i> per pair, and out of this she has to find cotton
and "trimmings." If she does this at home she pays 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week for the hire of a sewing-machine. The "finishers,"
as the women are called who press the garments, put on the
tickets, and generally make them ready for sale, are paid
from 2<i>d.</i> to 2-3/4<i>d.</i> a pair; but they lose a good deal of time in
getting their work examined, and have frequently to stand
three or four hours at a time. It is an invariable rule that
no seats are provided for women when they take their work
to the sweaters. If the examiner finds the first two or three
pairs of trousers faulty, he will not go through the whole
work, but throws them at the unfortunate woman, and tells
her to take them back and alter them. In this way she
loses two days in doing one day's work.</p>

<p>Shirt-makers who make by machine the common kinds
of shirts, are paid 7<i>d.</i>, 8<i>d.</i>, and 9<i>d.</i> per dozen shirts for
machining. They can machine 1-1/2 dozen sevenpenny shirts
in a day, by working till midnight and later. The shirt-finishers,
who make the button-holes by hand and sew on
the buttons, get 3<i>d.</i> a dozen shirts, finding their own cotton,
and can finish 1-1/2 dozen to 2 dozen in a day. Silk mantles,
costing in the West End shops from £1 to £25, are made
throughout in the East End for 7-1/2<i>d.</i> apiece, out of which
the sweater pays the actual maker 5<i>d.</i> The common
mantles are made at 5<i>d.</i> apiece; price to the worker, 3<i>d.</i> to
3-1/2<i>d.</i> Bead-trimmings are made by girls who, working
twelve hours, earn from 8<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> per day. Mackintoshes
are made at from 10<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> apiece.</p>

<p>Mrs. Killick, a trouser-finisher, told the Sweating Committee
that she could not make more than 1<i>s.</i> a day,
working from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. She had a sick husband and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
three children, and out of her earnings she paid 2<i>s.</i> a week
rent. She chiefly lived on tea and a bit of fish. What a
glimpse of patient heroism and noble self-denial does the
evidence of this poor woman afford!</p>

<p>Five or six years ago these women made nearly double;
the competition chiefly caused by the influx of cheap labour
from abroad, has reduced prices some 40 or 50 per cent.
Now, even the miserable wages earned are irregularly paid.
The sweaters frequently keep their workers waiting for their
money, and the more disreputable ones will cheat them out
of their just dues. Work too is precarious; there are slack
times during the year, when the workers may be idle for
weeks together; yet they must still pay rent, and keep body
and soul together&mdash;if they can. And this brings me back
to the proposition from which I started.</p>

<p>How body and soul are kept together in the case of girls
under such circumstances as have been detailed, it is not
difficult though very painful to imagine. Working from
dawn till night in hideous filth and squalor unutterable, for
a wage which does not suffice to buy the barest necessaries
(a wage cut down ever lower and lower by the fierce competition
from the shoals of destitute foreigners landed in
London week by week), hundreds, nay thousands of young
women&mdash;Englishwomen, our sisters&mdash;eke out their wretched
earnings by means of the street. The Pharisee and the
Self-righteous pass by on the other side and condemn them;
but it is not these poor unfortunates who are to be condemned,
but the system which makes such a state of things
possible. The Vicar of Old Ford, in his evidence before the
House of Lords' Committee, mentioned cases he knew of
where young girls of thirteen, who work in this cheap
tailoring trade, were leading an immoral life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>In one instance, two sisters, one twelve and the other ten
years of age, had already embarked upon a life of shame.
One of these girls had been sent out by her stepmother,
because the family "had to live."</p>

<p>Another instance, if possible more horrible still, was
related to me by a clergyman in the East End of London,
of a case which had come under his notice, though not
before it was too late. It was that of a woman, an Englishwoman,
a seamstress, who with her husband was engaged
in the cheap tailoring trade at the usual sweating prices.
All went fairly well for a time, for the two were able by their
united efforts to earn a living, and to maintain themselves
and their little children in a state of comparative decency
and comfort. But one winter the husband, never a strong
man, fell ill and died. The wife laboured on, managing by
some almost superhuman effort to earn enough for herself
and the children, and to keep body and soul together.
Then the slack time, so greatly dreaded by all those engaged
in the "sweating trade," came on, and there was nothing to
be done for weeks and weeks. In despair this woman, who
had hitherto led a blameless life, took to the streets. "It
was wrong," the moralist and purist will say, "wrong and
reprehensible to the last degree. Is there not the workhouse
for such people, is there not parochial relief, are there not
charitable agencies, free dinners, clothing clubs, district
visitors without end? Could she not have applied to one of
these instead of drifting into sin?" It may be so. All that I
know is, that she and her children were starving, and that
the sin brought its own punishment, for the poor woman
never recovered from the horrors of that awful winter. The
shame of it all seemed to settle on her as a blight, and the
following year she died, broken-spirited, and broken-hearted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
one more victim sacrificed to this infamous system of
starvation prices and ruinous competition.</p>

<p>Most of the English girls to be seen at night in
Oxford Street and the Strand, to say nothing of their even
more degraded sisters in Whitechapel, are, or have been,
tailoresses. How these poor creatures manage to exist at
all, even when they eke out their wretched earnings by the
price paid for their dishonour, it is not easy to see. The
key of the mystery is to be found in their mutual help of
one another. Even amid all their degradation and shame,
many of them retain that divine instinct of self-sacrifice
which in all ages has been the noblest part of womanhood.
Dim it may be and undeveloped, but still it is there, evidenced
daily by many little acts of kindness, many little generous
deeds towards those who are more miserable and more
suffering than themselves. "It is mostly the poor who help
the poor." I will go further and say, it is mostly the
wretched who help the wretched, for between them exists that
intimate knowledge of each other's sorrows which is the
truest bond of sympathy. Under happier circumstances
these poor women might have lived honest and virtuous
lives. As it is, they have to work side by side with men of
all nationalities, under unhealthy and objectionable conditions&mdash;conditions
subservient of all sense of decency.
This, combined with the utterly inadequate wage, naturally
leads to immorality, with its attendant satellites of drunkenness,
disease, and death. Thus the burden of wretchedness
and crime goes on, ever increasing in volume and intensity.
How can it be otherwise when the ranks of the lost in our
large cities, are thus being continually recruited from within
and from without? Every now and then the public conscience
is startled by the news of some awful tragedy&mdash;some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
poor creature done to her death in Whitechapel. It is but
a bubble bursting on the surface, which oozes up from the
black depths of vice and misery beneath.</p>

<p>One of the most potent causes of this vice and misery is
undoubtedly the unlimited pouring in of destitute and
objectionable foreigners. Again I ask, Can nothing be done
to rescue these women&mdash;our sisters&mdash;from the attendant
horrors of this fierce and degrading foreign competition?
Can nothing be done to place the price of their labour upon
such a level as to enable them by honest work to lead
virtuous and happy lives?</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Usque quo Domine?</i> Lord, how long? Such is the bitter
cry of the workwomen in East London.</p>

<h2 class="title"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a>
<br />THE SANITARY DANGER.</h2>


<p>The sanitary conditions amid which the great majority
of these alien immigrants labour and live may truly be
described as appalling. It is a remarkable thing that just
as the lower organisms of animal life are capable of living
under circumstances which are intolerable to higher organisms,
so can these people exist&mdash;and even to a certain
extent thrive&mdash;in an atmosphere and amid surroundings
which to the more highly-developed Englishman and
Englishwoman mean disease and death. Cleanliness and
sanitation are peculiarities of Western rather than of Eastern
nationalities. When Peter the Great went back to Russia
after his famous visit to London two centuries ago, he
left behind him such a filthy habitation, that the cleansing
of it had to be defrayed by an especial grant from the
Exchequer. This is a matter of history; and if rumour is
to be believed, a similar experience in connection with the
visit of an Oriental potentate has occurred in very recent
years. If this sort of thing is incidental to the visit of
Eastern Princes, how much rather then is it liable to
accompany the wholesale inundation of poor and degraded
foreigners, who flock into London and our large cities from
every country in Europe?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>In treating of this sanitary aspect, in order to avoid any
possible charge of exaggeration, I prefer to quote the statements
of unimpeachable authorities rather than to advance
any theories of my own. The surroundings amid which
these people are content to labour and to live are deplorable
and filthy beyond description. To quote from the Majority
Report of the Sweating Committee&mdash;a Report which has
been attacked because of the undue moderation of its
language, and which certainly cannot be said to unduly
exaggerate the evil:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Three or four gas-jets may be flaring in a room, a
coke fire burning in the wretched fire-place, sinks untrapped,
closets without water, and, altogether, the sanitary conditions
abominable. A witness told us that in a double room,
perhaps 9 feet by 15 feet, a man, his wife, and six children
slept, and in the same room ten men were usually employed,
so that at night eighteen persons would be in that one
room. These witnesses alluded to the want of sanitary
precautions, and of decent and sufficient accommodation, and
declared that the effects of this, combined with the inadequate
wages earned, had the effect of driving girls to
prostitution."</p>

<p>The state of the sweaters' dens in East London is revolting
beyond measure, and resembles rather the description of
Dante's <cite>Inferno</cite>, than the abodes of a professedly civilized
people. Here is the description of one taken almost at
random from a mass of evidence teeming with similar
details. A Factory Inspector, who described it, says it gives
a fair idea of all the rest, and he certainly ought to know,
seeing that some 4000 factories and "workshops innumerable"
are under his inspection. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You find a filthy bed, on which garments which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
made are laid; little children, perfectly naked little things,
lying about on the floor and on the bed; frying-pans and
all sorts of dirty utensils with food of various descriptions
on the bed, under the bed, over the bed, everywhere;
clothes hanging on a line, with nothing more than a large
gas-stove with the ashes all flying about, and the atmosphere
so dense that you get ill after a night's work there; and
that is the reason I am deaf now."</p>

<p>In respect of sanitation, the foreign Jews appear to be
the worst offenders. The Sanitary Committee of the Jewish
Board of Guardians admit in their Report that of 880
houses visited by the inspector, 623 were defective, and
below the standard required by the Local Authority. Of
these no less than 341 were in Whitechapel alone. To
quote a few samples:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In Whitechapel, some so-called 'Model Dwellings'
exist, in which the drain of a water-closet had been entirely
stopped up for three weeks prior to the visit of the Inspector,
while two of the cellars (inhabited) were flooded with
sewage, and had been so flooded for four days past.
At another place, where a noxious odour had prevailed for
years, the refuse which the Committee succeeded in causing
to be removed from the basement room, contained among
its various components the dead bodies of five cats, a dog,
and a rabbit. The water-closet drains of three other houses
were discovered on the Inspector's visit to have remained in
a choked condition for three, five, and six weeks respectively.
At a house in St. George's-in-the-East, three boot-finishers
were found at work in a front basement room, while the
adjoining back basement room was flooded with sewage,
which forced its way up a gully supposed to be protected by
a bell-trap. The cover of this trap, as is generally the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
with these appliances, was absent, and thus the sewer had
direct and unobstructed communication with the interior
of the house."</p>

<p>This extract is taken bodily from the Report of the
Sweating Committee of the Jewish Board of Guardians.
They are writing of their own people, and are certainly not
likely to exaggerate the state of affairs.</p>

<p>The habitations of the Italians are little better; in fact in
many ways they are just as bad. The sanitary arrangements
of the cheap dwellings around Saffron Hill, where the Italians
mostly abound, leave everything to be desired. On this
subject I had lately some conversation with an officer of the
Italian Benevolent Society. He described to me a sleeping-room&mdash;it
often served as a living-room as well&mdash;in one
of the ordinary dwelling-houses in the neighbourhood of
Saffron Hill. In this one room, neither very lofty nor
very large, may frequently be found a dozen persons herded
together rather like cattle than human beings, sleeping
promiscuously as follows:&mdash;In one bed, or what serves as a
bed, a married couple; in the next, two young girls; in a
third, a single young man; in the fourth, three or four
children of different ages and sexes&mdash;and so on. Owing to
the lack of ventilation, and the number of human beings
crowded in the room&mdash;to quote the words of my informant&mdash;"the
stench was awful." The result of all this upon the
victims, both physically and morally, can easily be imagined.
Another instance was that given by Inspector Holland to
Mr. Biron the magistrate.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> An Italian, who was summoned
for sending his little girl out begging, was traced to his
home, and there the police inspector found the parents
occupying a miserably furnished little apartment in Aldis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Mews, with six children. The room, which "smelt horribly,"
contained a single bed, under which were kept the appliances
for making ice-cream; and Inspector Holland also found
the room to be inhabited by a dog, a cat, a monkey, and
several white mice. The moral of all this is obvious, viz.
that these people are able to live under conditions amid
which it would be impossible for an average Englishman
to exist at all. Therefore it is only one more illustration
of the unfair nature of this unnatural competition.</p>

<p>There is, however, another point to be noted in connection
with this sanitary aspect. The conditions under which
work is done in the sweaters' dens, and in their homes by
these unfortunate people, largely assists in the spreading of
infectious diseases. I refer of course more especially to
the cheap tailoring trade. Some materials carry infection
very quickly. Dr. Bate, a medical officer of health in the
East End of London, speaks, in his evidence before the
Sweating Committee, of infection being carried far and
wide by the garments being often made up in rooms where
children are lying ill with small-pox, scarlet fever, and other
maladies. He had seen the garments thrown over the
children's beds; and a case is mentioned of a child covered
with measles being wrapt up in one of the half-made
garments to keep it warm. And yet the articles made
under such conditions are sold in the cheap, ready-made
clothes-shops all over London and throughout the provinces.</p>

<p>Nor are matters in the foreign quarters of the provincial
towns much better. From Manchester, from Leeds, from
Liverpool, from Glasgow, the same tale reaches us, of the
filthy habits of these foreign immigrants, and their neglect
of all sanitary precautions. For instance, at Meadow Bank,
an outlying district of Winsford, there is a large colony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Poles and Hungarians. They are employed in some local
salt works, and were especially brought over to England
some years ago in consequence of a strike in the Salt
District, and now fill the places which were formerly occupied
by Englishmen. A description of the way in which
these people live, will best show how impossible it is for
decent English workmen to compete against them. It
is best told in the words of Dr. Fox, the medical officer
of the District Board of Health. In his report he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To say that these people are living together like beasts
would be an insult and a libel upon beasts. Beasts would
be better provided for than are those human beings. In
the first place the rooms are, without exception, overcrowded.
Again, they are destitute of furniture. The beds are trays
covered with filthy straw; the bed-clothing is entirely constituted
of filthy sacking. The men sleep in their clothes,
even in their boots. The windows are rarely if ever opened;
the beds in point of fact being many of them never empty;
one set of workmen occupying them by day, and another
by night. The atmosphere is necessarily foul, f&oelig;tid, and
pestilential to persons of ordinary susceptibilities; and yet,
in the absence of larders, and kitchens, and separate living-rooms,
in this f&oelig;tid, stinking atmosphere the food is stored
and cooked. Arrangements for washing there are none,
except the outside taps. In one room six men and one
woman are sleeping, unmarried, promiscuously; and in
another, a man, his wife, and daughter&mdash;fourteen years
of age&mdash;were occupying one bed. Canal-boats are palaces
and temples of cleanliness, comfort, and morality, compared
with this horrible colony of Bohemianism."</p>

<p>It is not possible to say anything which would add to this
tale of horror. The facts speak for themselves. Dr. Fox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
though subjected to a severe examination before the House
of Commons' Committee, maintained that there was not
a syllable of exaggeration in his report, though in consequence
of public attention having been attracted by its
publication, a slight improvement had since taken place in
some minor details. There was no necessity, it should be
noted, for these foreigners to live in the way they did. In
this instance they were paid a sufficient wage for them to
exist under decent and sanitary conditions. It was simply
that they preferred doing so, and were but following the
instincts of a nature which had become engendered in them
by long years of filthy and degraded habits. Yet it was
to make room for such as these that the English workmen
were ousted, and are being ousted daily, in the great manufacturing
centres of Great Britain. The question is, therefore,
how long are these people to be allowed to pour in upon us
unchecked, bringing with them their foreign habits and
customs, and living in conformity with these alone, an
outstanding defiance to English law, and a serious danger
to the health and well-being of the surrounding English
community? Is it right or just that our people should be
forced by this unnatural competition to live and toil side
by side with such people, surrounded by bad light, bad
air, bad food, bad water, bad smells, bad and degrading
occupations&mdash;by every circumstance which depresses the
vital energies, and leaves them an easy prey to pestilence?
But we are told that to shut our doors upon these aliens
would be to reverse England's traditions. I maintain that
we have lavished sympathy enough upon them already, and
that it is now necessary for us to keep a little of our sympathy
for our own flesh and blood. It is impossible to
over-estimate the importance of sanitation. Where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
neglected, disease and death surely follow. Doctors tell us
that more human beings are killed in England every year
by unnecessary and preventible diseases, than were killed
at Waterloo or Sadowa, and the great majority of these
victims are children. Preventible diseases, according to
Sir Joseph Fayrer, still kill 125,000 per annum, entailing a
loss of labour from sickness estimated at £7,750,000 per
annum. "Why then," as the Prince of Wales<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> asked, "are
they not prevented?"</p>

<p>Sanitary legislation is all very well, but it deals with effects
and not with causes. Such dens as those described, not by
my imagination, be it noted, but by unimpeachable authorities,
are nothing less than breeding-houses of pestilence. If we
swept them clean to-morrow others would soon be found as
bad, for the filthy and unsanitary habits of these immigrant
aliens are bred in the bone, and wherever they go they take
them with them. It cannot be healthy for a nation to have
such a sore as this existing in its side, yet we allow this
plague-spot to continue in our midst, and to spread its
contamination far and wide. If we wish to perpetuate that
healthy, sturdy stock which has made England what she is,
we must prevent the strain from being defiled by this
ceaseless pouring in of the unclean and unhealthy of other
lands. "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump," and
nothing is more contagious than dirty and unsanitary habits.
The physical health of the people should be the first care of
the State, for upon it depends not only the present, but the
future, of our race. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salus populi suprema est lex</i>&mdash;and before
this inviolable law all other considerations must bow.</p>

<p>The Majority Report of the Sweating Committee&mdash;from
which Lord Dunraven dissented&mdash;complacently recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the more frequent use of "limewash" in the
sweaters' dens and workshops where these indigent
foreigners chiefly congregate. But it will require a great
deal more than "limewash" to whiten this hideous evil.
People who bring with them filthy and unsanitary habits are
a standing source of danger to the rest of the community.
Cattle from an infected district are refused admission to our
ports; surely the health of even one of the meanest of our
people is of more importance than many cattle.</p>

<br />THE SOCIAL EVIL.</h2>


<p>Closely bound up with the sanitary danger, indeed
inseparable from it, is the social evil. The value of healthy
habitations, of personal cleanliness, of pure air, of a sufficient
but not exorbitant amount of work&mdash;all that in fact
tends to produce the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens sana in corpore sano</i>&mdash;all this is
fully acknowledged and known; yet we freely throw open
our doors to a class whose habits and customs admittedly
militate against all these powerful agencies for good.</p>

<p>The unlimited pouring in of destitute and degraded
foreigners tends both directly and indirectly to increase our
national burden of pauperism, vice, and crime. With regard
to the first part of this statement it is often objected that
but few of these foreign immigrants come upon the rates,
and that our workhouses and penitentiaries show comparatively
faint signs of their presence. This is a half-truth, and
like all half-truths it conceals a most dangerous fallacy.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nulla falsa doctrina est, quae non permisceat aliquid veritatis.</i>
On the surface I admit the plausibility of the objection.
In Leeds, for instance, where the foreign colony has reached
abnormal proportions, the total number of Jews chargeable
to the common fund of the Leeds Union, at the time when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
particulars were furnished to the Board of Trade in the
early part of this year (1891), was only 62. The numerous
Jewish and Foreign Benevolent Societies and Charitable
Institutions are far too careful to allow their people to come
upon the rates more than they can possibly help. But that
the whole tendency of this destitute foreign immigration is
to force those of our English working-classes, who are in
any degree affected by it, into pauperism or something
worse, cannot for one moment be denied by those who have
any practical knowledge of the poor in the crowded centres
of population to which these undesirable foreigners flock.</p>

<p>In proof of this assertion, I may quote the opinion of the
Mile End Board of Guardians, who believed that this destitute
foreign immigration had "a deteriorating effect upon
the moral, financial, and social conditions of the people."
The Whitechapel Guardians of the poor also deplore the
substitution of the foreign for the English population. The
result, they say, is the lowering of the general condition of
the people. The Hackney Board of Guardians also, after
an exhaustive inquiry, arrived at the opinion that the unchecked
immigration of destitute foreigners was a serious
social danger, reducing wages to a "starvation point."
They supported their decision by a series of practical and
convincing arguments which only lack of space prevents my
quoting in full.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>If a life of honest labour has no better reward to offer
than the meagre wages and attendant horrors of the sweaters'
dens, can it be wondered if in despair of earning an honest
livelihood, hundreds, nay thousands, of our people are
tempted to abandon the unequal struggle, and to drift into
idleness, drunkenness, and vice? I have endeavoured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
show in a previous chapter how this unnatural competition
forces Englishwomen upon the streets; but that, alas! is not
the only resultant form of vice. A great social reformer<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
once said that "he had found a man's sobriety to be in
direct proportion to his cleanliness." Without admitting the
universal accuracy of this opinion, there is no doubt that it
contains within it the germs of a great truth. Drunkenness,
that endless source of misery and crime, is not in itself so
much a cause as an effect, the effect of the loss of that
innate sense of self-respect which forms one of the great
barriers between the man and the beast. "When we
examine into the ultimate cause of a dangerous class," writes
Canon Kingsley,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> "into the one property common to all its
members, whether thieves, beggars, profligates, or the merely
pauperized&mdash;we find it to be this loss of self-respect. As
long as that remains, poor souls may struggle on heroically,
pure amid penury, filth, degradation unspeakable. But
when self-respect is lost, they are lost with it. And whatever
may be the fate of virtuous parents, children brought
up in these dens of physical and moral filth cannot retrieve
self-respect. They sink, and they must sink, into a life on a
level with the sights, sounds, aye, the very smells, which
surround them."</p>

<p>All this is true enough. But how, I would ask, is it
possible for our people to maintain this precious sense of
self-respect when they are forced daily and hourly into
contact with those who appear to have no more idea of
decency, cleanliness, and comfort than the beasts which
perish? The whole physical circumstances of their lives
fight against them. To the great bulk of these immigrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
aliens, the word "home," that word so sacred to English
ears, around which so many associations cling, has no
meaning at all. They appear to have only one dominant
passion, the love of gain;&mdash;not that they gain much, poor
creatures, still it is there;&mdash;and in their pursuit of it they are
willing to accommodate themselves to the meagre wage, the
lengthy hours, and the filthy surroundings already described.
With this exception they appear to be indifferent to everything
which makes life worth the living, to have no happiness
in the past, no pleasures in the present, no hope in
the future. With our own people it is different. However
degraded they may be, there exists among them the longing
for enjoyment. "Not to enjoy is not to live." Moral and
intellectual enjoyments many have none; and in default
of these, they betake themselves to the lowest forms of
animal enjoyment; snatching at their pleasures greedily,
foully, all the more fiercely because their opportunities of
enjoyment are so limited. Can we wonder that these things
are so? Can we judge them harshly? God forbid!</p>

<p>A well-known social reformer, for whose work and opinions
I have the greatest respect, has written:&mdash;"It is a fact apparent
to every thoughtful man, that the larger portion of the
misery that constitutes our social question arises from
indulgence, gluttony, drink, waste, profligacy, betting, and
dissipation."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This on the surface is true enough; but when
we come to examine more closely into the problems of
poverty, we shall find that though intemperance, unthrift,
self-indulgence, and inefficiency are unhappily the common
vices of the poor, yet these vices are not so much the <em>causes</em>
of poverty, as the <em>effects</em> of it.</p>

<p>The Rev. S. A. Barnett, of St. Jude's, Whitechapel, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
knows the East End of London so thoroughly, does not find
the origin of poverty in the vices of the poor. Terrible as
are the results of drunkenness, unthrift, and self-indulgence,
it is not possible, if we view the facts dispassionately, to
regard these as the main sources of poverty. We shall
rather look upon these evils as the natural outcome of the
fierce struggle for existence, which is carried on under our
present industrial conditions. Morality is admittedly the
truest and most real end of man, and therefore on a superficial
aspect it is natural to represent the miseries of the
very poor to be chiefly occasioned by their own faults. It is a
comfortable view to take, for it at once lightens the responsibility
of the rich man, and it salves his conscience by the
specious plea that after all the poor and the wretched have
brought half their troubles upon themselves; and as they
have made their beds, so must they lie. But this is rather
the attitude of the Pharisee than of the philanthropist, and
the moral and social problems of our age and country will
never be solved if approached in such a spirit.</p>

<p>It is a cruel and unholy thing thus to intensify the
struggle for existence among our own people by the
ceaseless immigration of those, who, to quote the words
of the Bishop of Bedford, "are at once demoralized and
demoralizing."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Few have had more practical experience
of the crowded East End of London than Dr. Billing,
and he has given eloquent testimony to the injury worked
upon our own people there by this wholesale invasion. In
this fierce battle for life, of what use is it to utter trite platitudes
about the "survival of the fittest," since, as another
great authority, Lord Dunraven, has pointed out, "the fittest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in this instance are those who are able to exist upon the
lowest possible diet, in the greatest possible filth, and subject
to the greatest amount of hardships and misery"?<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Englishmen and Englishwomen were not formed thus
to live, and thus to toil. They cannot do so without contracting
diseased habits of body and mind&mdash;without becoming
brutalized, in fact. They lose their self-respect, and
go to swell that degraded class into which the <em>weaker</em> as
well as the <em>worst</em> members of society show a perpetual
tendency to sink&mdash;a class which not respecting itself does
not respect others, which has nothing to lose and all to gain,
and in which the lowest passions are ever ready to burst out
and avenge themselves by frightful methods. That is why
it is, at the present hour, in the crowded courts and
teeming alleys of East London, there exist all the elements
of something even more terrible in its way than the misery
which brought about the French Revolution.</p>

<p>It has been said that "A great city is a great evil." But
paradoxical as it may seem, it is also a great good, since
it provides employment for many thousands who otherwise
would starve. Still it cannot be denied that the abnormal
increase of our great cities, and the gradual depopulation of
our country districts, form one of the most serious social
problems of our time.</p>

<p>There is a constant movement going on from the
country to the town. This is due to many causes, one of
which is undoubtedly the introduction of machinery, which,
whilst lessening the work for labourers in the agricultural
districts, at the same time creates an extraordinary demand
for "hands" in our manufacturing centres. Another cause
is the higher rate of wages, and the bustling customs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
town, which never cease to offer attractions to young people
starting in life. The result of this steady current of human
beings flowing away from the country to the town is disastrous
to both. Every great city in England is rapidly
approaching a state of congestion; and in rural places there
is a great dearth of workers, the supply falling very far short
of the demand. If the 30,000,000 human beings in England
and Wales all had food and lodging, there would be no
cause for anxiety; but a large number of them are very
poor, and wholly unable to support themselves. In 1890
no less than 671,000 persons received Poor Law relief, of
whom 462,000 were relieved outside, and 179,000 inside the
workhouse. In London alone 5000 able-bodied men were
relieved every day, at a cost to the Metropolitan rate-payers
of £188,000 per year. Twenty-four out of every hundred,
or nearly one quarter of those who died in London last year,
died either in the workhouses, hospitals, or lunatic asylums.
Therefore, considering this question of foreign immigration
generally, and foreign Jewish immigration in particular, we
must take into account the nature of its distribution and the
gregarious habits of the Jewish immigrants. The weekly
arrival of hundreds of semi-starving foreigners must of
necessity have a serious effect upon our unskilled labour
market in London and our great provincial cities, to which
the immigrant aliens principally flock. All thinking persons
will admit that it is of more importance to protect our
own workmen than to preserve our traditional character
for hospitality, if it can be shown&mdash;and I consider it can&mdash;that
the exercise of such hospitality tends to degrade the
social condition of the native workers.</p>

<p>Why then add to the difficulties of this problem by letting
in yearly thousands of these foreigners, chiefly the "lowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
class of the lowest class," who, parasites that they are, flock
at once to our great centres of population, and prey upon
our people, underselling their labour, and taking the bread
from their mouths?</p>

<p>We live in the days of a great social upheaval. We hear
on all sides of the great "Labour movement." What does
it mean? What is at the bottom of it all? Only the desire
of our labouring classes to seek for themselves some alleviation
of their lot; some increased opportunity for leisure;
some better remuneration for their labour; some surer
provision against sickness and old age. They are seeking&mdash;not
always by the best and wisest methods perhaps, but
that is not their fault&mdash;how to make their lives better and
broader, healthier and happier. With these desires every
right-thinking man is in sympathy. The complete realization
of their dream may be Utopian perhaps&mdash;I do not know.
But even if it be, what is there to blame in this divine
discontent?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">"Unless above himself he can</div>
<div class="verse">Exalt himself, how mean a thing is man!"</div>
</div>

<p>How are these longings to be gratified?&mdash;how are they
to be even partially realized, while this unchecked flood of
destitution and degradation pours in upon us from abroad?</p>

<p>We hear much in these days of schemes for elevating
and evangelizing the masses of the poor in our great cities.
All honour to such schemes, whether they succeed or
whether they fail, for the motive which animates them is good.
But it cannot be too often insisted upon, that spiritual and
intellectual necessities do not arise until some decency of
physical conditions has been first attained. Among the
"submerged tenth," as they have been called, decency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
physical conditions will never come to pass until steps have
first been taken to forbid the entrance of the unclean and
unhealthy of other lands. So long as the bare struggle for
existence absorbs all the energies of our very poor, they
cannot be civilized.</p>

<p>I do not underrate the greater worth of the moral life
as compared with the purely physical life; but we must
begin at the lowest rung of the ladder before we can ascend
to the highest. As things are, the dregs of our slum population
have neither the time, the energy, or the desire
to be clean, thrifty, intelligent, or moral. In our haste we
must not blame them. What they want first of all is
better food, and more of it, warmer clothes, better shelter,
higher wages, and more permanent employment. Unless
we can first assist them to obtain these material desires,
all our efforts to awaken the higher part of their natures
will be in vain. Some perhaps will object that many
of these poor creatures are so brutalized, so criminal,
so degraded, that they have no higher nature left to
awaken. I do not believe it&mdash;I will never believe it.
However degraded a human being may be, however handicapped
from his birth by the circumstances of his life, and
even handicapped before his birth by the transmitted
vices of his progenitors, there still is implanted in him,
dormant and infinitesimal though it may be, that spark
of the divine nature which alone separates man from the
beast.</p>

<p>In writing on the social aspect of this evil, it is well to
make one's meaning quite plain. I do not of course mean
to say&mdash;no one can say&mdash;that to restrict the immigration
of the destitute, the criminal, or the worthless, would be a
panacea for all our social ills. Far from it; but it would at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
least remove from their way, one of the most potent causes
of degradation in the material and social condition of the
poor in our large cities. Until something has first been
done to check this evil, charitable agencies, religious movements,
colonization and emigration schemes will be beside
the mark. However much good they may do here and
there&mdash;and I freely admit the amount of good that such
movements have done, and are doing every day&mdash;they will
fail to go to the root of the evil, since they deal with effects
and not with causes; they treat the symptoms, but not
the disease.</p>

<p>Emigration is worthless while this continuous influx is
allowed to go on. At the best, emigration is a drastic
remedy only to be applied in the last resource. If, like the
Great Plague, or Fire of London, emigration carried off the
diseased, or swept away foul and unhealthy tenements,
it might possibly be regarded with more complacency. But
under existing circumstances this is just what emigration
does not do. We must bear in mind that we can no longer
draft off our social failures to other countries. Even our
colonies now refuse to take the "wreckage" of the mother
country. The people we emigrate now, are just those we
can least afford to lose. And there is another consideration.
Of the thousands we emigrate yearly, most are men, young,
healthy, and vigorous. Of the women, all&mdash;or nearly all&mdash;are
virtuous and industrious. In either sex the residuum,
both men and women, and more especially women, remain
behind. "Bad men die, but bad women multiply," once
said a lady whose name is a synonym for all that is charitable
and good, when urging the advisability of giving the
fallen sisterhood of our great cities a chance of beginning
life over again in some new land beyond the seas. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
are pregnant words, but under our present system little or
no provision is made for carrying them into effect. Things
have come to such a pass, that while we emigrate the flower
of our population, the industrious, the vigorous, and the
courageous; the feeble, the idle, and the worthless remain
with us; and this undesirable increment is ever being augmented
by the refuse population of other countries.</p>

<p>Look at it from whatever point we will, it cannot be right
that these things should be.</p>

<br />LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.</h2>


<p>The laws and customs of Europe with regard to the
treatment of destitute and undesirable immigration vary
considerably. For the purpose of convenience in dealing
with this aspect, the European countries may be roughly
divided into three classes, (<i>a</i>) Those which have decrees
and restrictions both for prohibiting the admission of
destitute aliens, and for expelling such as have resided in
their territory, when for divers reasons they should appear
to be unwelcome or undesirable acquisitions. (<i>b</i>) Those
which have laws and local regulations for the expulsion of
aliens, but none prohibiting their admission into the country
in the first instance. (<i>c</i>) Those which take no steps in the
matter at all. To the first of these three classes belong
Austria, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria,
Roumania, Saxony, and Bavaria. To the second class,
Spain, Sweden and Norway, Greece, Germany (all States
except the two previously specified), Italy, Hungary, Servia,
Montenegro, and in a lesser degree, France. To the last
belong Portugal, and until the other day, Turkey. The
remaining country is Russia; but having been unable to
obtain any very definite information concerning it, I have
hesitated to classify it with any of the above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be best to take these classes and countries <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seriatim</i>.</p>

<p>In Austria the regulations vary slightly with regard to
particular provinces; but, speaking generally, special instructions
have been issued to the frontier police, with the result
that all vagrant aliens, deserters, suspicious-looking foreigners
who are not able to give a proper account of themselves or
as to the sufficiency of their means, foreign pedlars, workmen
and artisans who on entrance into the country are
uncertain of obtaining immediate employment, or whose
papers are unsatisfactory, or whose means for travelling are
insufficient&mdash;all these are at once to be refused admission,
and to be turned back at the frontier. The only exception
to this rule is the case of foreign day-labourers and artisans,
who are entitled by reason of reciprocity to the same treatment
as Austrian subjects of the same class receive in the
States to which these belong, whose appearance gives rise to
no suspicion, and who having regular passports are obliged,
in order to return to their homes by the most direct route,
to pass through Austrian territory. By the Ordinance of
1867, foreign beggars, mountebanks, singers, musicians,
jugglers, rope-dancers, gipsies, and other vagrant people,
proprietors of wax-works, owners of menageries and similar
exhibitions, unless they have first obtained a licence to
exhibit the same in the Empire, are also refused admittance
and turned back at the frontier. As to continued residence,
by the General Communal Laws a Commune can refuse to
allow foreigners to reside in its district, if they, together
with their belongings, do not lead a blameless life, or if they
become a burden upon public charity. By the Banishment
Law of 1871, the Communal Police are also empowered
to forcibly expel from the territory all idle or vagrant
foreigners, discharged convicts, and foreign prostitutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
especially if these pursue their immoral trade without strictly
observing the police regulations, if they are suffering from
venereal disease, if they cause a public scandal by their
behaviour, or if they seduce young people. Such, in brief, are
the laws which regulate and restrict alien immigration in the
Austrian Empire, as distinct from the kingdom of Hungary.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of M. de Bille, the Danish Minister
at the Court of St. James's, who kindly procured for me from
Copenhagen a copy of the Decree of 1875, and other law-records,
I have been enabled to make a detailed study of
the laws of Denmark which bear upon this question.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The
law of 1875, containing the regulation in force in regard to
foreigners and travellers in Denmark, is a very drastic one.
Briefly summarized, it amounts to this. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status</i> and
liberties of the foreign workman or servant, employed or
seeking employment in Denmark, are defined with very
great attention to detail; the most uncompromising regulations
are laid down for the prevention of the entry of all
foreigners who may be found destitute of sufficient means
for their support; and even of those who are in search of
work under any circumstances, except under strict conditions.
The first Article contains a positive prohibition
against the admission into the country of foreign gipsies,
itinerant musicians, leaders and exhibitors of animals,
acrobats and jugglers, who seek to gain a livelihood by
vagrant performances. Foreigners in search of work are not
admitted, except on the condition that they are provided
with a document of identity from a public functionary.
From the succeeding Articles of the same law it appears
that foreigners who are not possessed of any claim for
maintenance in Denmark, and are destitute of the means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
subsistence, are to be expelled by the police, and the method
of expulsion is very carefully detailed. Even those who
find employment are constantly under the supervision of
the police, and have pass-books, which, at every change of
domicile or of employment, must be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">visé</i> by the police as
well as by the employers. There can be no doubt that the
severity of the law is very effectual in exterminating the evil
against which it is aimed. On the other hand, it in no way
deters considerable numbers of foreign skilled artisans from
seeking and obtaining employment in Denmark, as any
one with any knowledge of the country would speedily
discover. The majority of such foreigners appear to be
Germans.</p>

<p>In Belgium the measures which the Government is
authorized to take with the view of protecting the country
against the dangers which the presence of destitute foreigners
involve, are based upon several laws and decrees which
have been passed from time to time as need required. They
are interesting having regard to the strikes and labour-troubles
which have taken place in Belgium during recent
years. By a decree of the Provisional Government of 1830,
all foreigners unprovided with a Government authorization,
are bound to show that they possess means of livelihood;
if not, they are at once to be sent back to their own
country. They are even liable to be brought before the
Juge de Paix, who may condemn them to a short imprisonment,
or send them to the agricultural colony of Hoogstraeten,
where native vagabonds are confined while at the
disposal of the Government. Since 1850, however, foreigners
are not as a rule brought before the Juge de Paix, instructions
having been given to the police authorities directing
them to reconduct to the frontier at once, and of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
accord, any foreigner arriving in Belgium and being evidently
destitute, or a vagabond. A report of the arrest and
a certificate of expulsion are, in this case, addressed to the
Administrator of the Public Safety, at the time when the
foreigner is sent out of the country. This summary procedure
is followed both in the interest of the Treasury as
saving expense, and in that of the foreigners themselves,
who thus escape a prolonged detention. When at a seaport,
and especially at Antwerp, foreign sailors are without means
of existence, the Maritime Commissaries endeavour to find
them an engagement on a ship about to sail; they are only
conducted to the land frontier if these efforts fail. Formerly
aliens, who were arrested for not having sufficient means of
subsistence, were allowed to choose the frontier by which
they might leave the kingdom. Of late years, however, this
right of choice has been considerably curtailed on account
of the attitude assumed by neighbouring countries. These
countries have not unnaturally showed a marked disinclination
to becoming a sort of rubbish-heap for Belgium.
Even little Luxemburg revolted at this state of affairs, and
a Convention was concluded with the Grand-Duchy by
which it was agreed that only natives of the country, Italian
subjects or Swiss citizens (these being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>), should in
future be forwarded across the Luxemburg frontier. The
German frontier is now absolutely closed to destitute
persons expelled from Belgian territory who are not of
German nationality. Holland has also followed suit, and
the Dutch authorities reconduct into Belgium by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">visé</i>, a
great number of aliens, transferred by prison vans to
Lanaken.</p>

<p>The law regulating the admission and expulsion of
foreigners from the Netherlands dates from 1849. Article I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of this law lays down as the first and indispensable
condition on which foreigners can be admitted into the
Netherlands, the possession by them of "sufficient means
of subsistence, or the faculty of acquiring such means by
work"; and upon the strength of this condition, and under
the provisions of Article IX. of the law, foreigners found on
Netherlands territory in a destitute condition and without
any ostensible means of earning a living, may be expelled
from the country; and, in fact, numbers of persons so
situated are expelled every year. All foreigners "dangerous
to the public peace" are also subject to immediate
expulsion.</p>

<p>The law and custom in force in the petty European States
of Bulgaria and Roumania is as follows. In Bulgaria the
constantly increasing number of vagrants in the capital
of Sophia, as well as in the coast of the Black Sea, and
on the Danube, has compelled the Government of the
Prince to increase the staff of police, in order, by a more
extensive supervision, to put an end to the difficult position
in which the Bulgarian population is admittedly placed by
alien vagrancy and destitution. The police authorities are
therefore bound to keep a strict watch on the strangers
arriving in the country, or residing there without occupation,
and to have recourse to the immediate expulsion across
the frontier of the Principality of all those who are unable
to afford surety of their intention to remain, or who attract
notice by their destitution, suspicious character, or culpable
actions. In Roumania, though there are no general Regulations
existing on the subject, the invariable custom is, that
persons who are evidently in a state of indigence are not
admitted to the country, unless they could prove that they
possessed the means of subsistence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>In the German Kingdom of Saxony, though there are
no laws on the subject, it is competent for the authorities to
prohibit the admission or residence of destitute aliens. In
Bavaria also the competent police authorities are allowed
to expel a foreigner from the kingdom if this course should
appear to be of public expediency; and besides this, the
Minister of the Interior is empowered to refuse entrance into
the kingdom to foreigners who may be liable to become
either a public nuisance or a public burden.</p>

<p>We now come to the second class, namely, those countries
which have laws and local regulations for the expulsion
of aliens, but have neither law nor custom for prohibiting
their admission into the country in the first instance.</p>

<p>Of these we will first take Germany, including all the
States with the exception of the kingdoms of Bavaria and
Saxony. It is held by international law, that each State has
the power of expelling from its territory aliens who may
have rendered themselves obnoxious or dangerous to it.
Destitute persons convicted of vagabondage or begging,
or who, after becoming destitute, have been unable to
procure a subsistence for themselves within a period of time
laid down by the police, can be placed under arrest, and be
handed over to the Government police ("Landespolizei"),
who in aggravated cases can consign them to the workhouse;
but destitute aliens thus handed over to the police authorities,
instead of being consigned to the workhouse, are as a rule
expelled at once from the territory of the Empire. In the
little kingdom of Würtemburg, the Royal "Oberamts"
(provincial administrative authorities) have an uncontested
right to expel aliens from the kingdom. This right is
generally exercised when it is proved or even suspected that
the alien is unable to maintain himself; nor are such aliens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
entitled to any relief from the communal or charitable
institutions of the country.</p>

<p>In Sweden, by a Circular published in 1886, addressed to
the Governors of the Provinces, foreigners found without resources
in this country, and in a state of vagrancy, are directed
to be sent back by the authorities to their own country at
the expense of the Swedish Government; in case the country
to which the person belongs be so situated that he cannot
be forwarded there without having to wait on the road within
the boundaries of any other country, due notice is given
to the authorities at the place to which the person is sent.
As regards the treatment of destitute aliens in Norway,
should there be any found in that country, they are taken
care of by the police, and forwarded to their own country,
the expense being charged in the police accounts. Thus
it will be seen the custom in Sweden and Norway is perfectly
identical; only there is this difference in the latter country,
there are no laws, Royal or municipal, which sanction the
practice; it rests entirely upon custom.</p>

<p>The law in Spain amounts to this, that if a foreigner after
due inquiry is proved to be a vagrant, he is forced to leave
the country. The definition of a vagrant, according to the
law of Spain is, it should be noted, as follows:&mdash;"A person
who has no property or income, no habitual profession or
trade, nor any known or legitimate manner of living."</p>

<p>In Italy no special law exists, the residence of aliens in
that country being regulated by the common law; but
should such persons in the same manner as indigent natives
take to begging, or if they engage in no fixed or useful
labour, they can be arrested as idle persons, and dealt with
by the judicial authorities, who can inflict a punishment
upon them, and expel them from the King's dominions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Forcible expulsion is, however, only recurred to as an
extreme measure. Usually, aliens are sent back to their
own country with a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">foglio di via</i>, or pass.</p>

<p>In Switzerland the matter is met by the local enactments
of the different Cantons. Minute rules are laid down as to
the permit of residence to foreigners. Destitute aliens, bad
characters, tramps, and suspects are liable to an imprisonment
on bread and water, from four to eight days' duration.
They are then conducted to the frontier and expelled.</p>

<p>The custom observed in Servia, Hungary, Greece, and
Montenegro is all much the same. Either by penal codes, or
by the unwritten, but equally stringent, law of custom, the
foreigner who is found in any of these countries without
visible means of subsistence, and who has no occupation, is
requested to leave the country by the authorities, and should
he fail to comply, he is forcibly conducted to the frontier
and expelled.</p>

<p>The case of France, however, calls for more than passing
remark in that it differs considerably from the custom in
vogue in most European countries. There is no positive
or direct legislation properly so called for the purpose of
prohibiting aliens destitute or otherwise from entering
French territory. The question of expulsion is governed by
the law of 1849, which is applicable to the whole of France.
By Article VII. of this law, "Le Ministre de l'Intérieur
pourra, par mesure de police, enjoindre à tout étranger voyageant
ou résidant en France de sortir immédiatement du
territoire Français et le faire conduire à la frontière." This
law, however, it should be noted, emanated from an idea of
social and political protection; it had no economical design,
and it does not touch the question of destination. There is
a Bill at present lying before the Chamber of Deputies for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the purpose of amending the law of 1849; it has been
lying there five or six years, and has not yet been proceeded
with. On immigration, properly so called, France has only
at present legislated for her colonies on purely special
points. The silence of the Statute Law on this subject is to
be accounted for on various grounds. France recruits her
population in other ways than by the normal growth of the
inhabitants within her territory. Statistics show that of late
years the number of births in France has remained stationary,
but that notwithstanding this, her population has not
ceased to increase; this fact being due to the influx of
immigrant aliens, which is growing larger from year to year.
The fact that France has become a country of immigration
like America and Australia is a surprising phenomenon.
"It may not be impossible," writes M. Edouard Clouet, the
advocate at the Court of Paris, "that these new economical
conditions will have some influence on future legislation,
and call for specific measures." Such measures, however,
are still in the future, and the astounding fact remains that
the immigration of aliens into France is estimated at an
average of about 100,000 souls per annum, while the native
population is stationary, if not decreasing.</p>

<p>The only European country which has no law or
recognized custom in dealing with destitute aliens is
Portugal. Until quite recently I should have included in
this category Turkey as well; but in October last (1891) the
long-suffering Ottoman Government, in order to prevent
the danger which would result to the public health from
the influx of Jewish immigrants from Russia, resolved in
future to forbid their entry into Ottoman territory. The
Porte also requested the British Ambassador at Constantinople
to cause a warning to be conveyed to British shipowners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to refuse passages to Jewish immigrants, who will
not be allowed by the maritime authorities to land. This
prohibition applies not only to immigrants from Russia, but
from any quarter whatsoever, whether in Western or Eastern
Europe. Individuals will be allowed to pass, but not families.</p>

<p>On the subject of alien immigration into Russia, or the
continued residence of destitute aliens therein, I have been
unable to obtain any definite information. The protective
policy of Russia in purging the Empire of all alien influences,
whether good or bad, is well known, and needs no comment
here. The expulsion of resident Germans from Russian
territory unless they consent to become naturalized, and the
recent edicts promulgated against the Jews, are however
illustrations of my meaning. In this Russia differs from all
other European countries. They are all willing to admit
the desirable alien, the skilled artisan, the foreigner who is
decent and law-abiding in his habits and mode of life. It
is only the destitute, the vagrant, the convict, the suspect,
the evil-liver that they object to. But Russia, it would seem,
has a dislike to all alien influence, whether for good or for
evil.</p>

<p>To sum up, therefore, it appears that in all European
nations&mdash;with one insignificant exception&mdash;some measures,
more or less drastic, are taken either for prohibiting the
admission, or for the expulsion of destitute and undesirable
aliens. This policy is the deliberate outcome of years of
thought and legislation. It is framed in the interests of the
native population in each country, and is in all cases fully
in accordance with the popular will. It is generally recognized
throughout Europe that it is the duty of every State to
deal with its own paupers and undesirable citizens, and it
is recognized also that the only way to bring about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
desirable end, is by other countries politely but firmly
refusing to admit them. Thus it may be safely said that in
the continent of Europe all countries liable to suffer from
undesirable immigration have taken steps to guard themselves
against it&mdash;with one single exception.</p>

<p>That exception is Great Britain.</p>

<h2 class="title"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a>
<br />THE EXAMPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.</h2>


<p>Twenty years ago it was a common calculation in the
United States that every new immigrant was worth a
thousand dollars to the particular State in which he settled.
A farm might be had for practically nothing by anybody
who chose to apply for it. In those comparatively early
days, what are now flourishing States west of the Mississippi,
were then, in parts, wild unpeopled wildernesses, and the
country could not afford to be very discriminative as to
either the character or the means of particular immigrants.
Thus for many years America was the camping-ground of
the social refuse of Europe. Irish paupers driven forth by
famine and political misrule went West in tens of thousands,
to become, many of them, prosperous farmers and worthy
citizens of their adopted country. But there came also, in
almost countless hordes, immigrants of a far less desirable,
and, as the sequel has proved, dangerous kind: Fenians and
apostles of dynamite from Ireland; secret societies from
Italy, whose gospel was murder and brigandage; Nihilists
from Russia, and Socialists from Germany, driven forth
almost at the point of the bayonet by their own Governments;
Russian and Polish Jews, fleeing in terror before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
fanatical persecution of the Czar. All this heterogeneous
mass of inflammable human material has at length become
a standing menace to the United States, endangering her
friendly relations with foreign countries, as well as the
freedom her own people enjoy under their present form of
government. Of course there were compensating advantages,
but the evil of unrestricted immigration has of late
years reached such an extent that the old sturdy race, the
descendants of the English Puritans, who made the great
Republic of the West, have been in danger of being gradually
swallowed up by foreign-born populations.</p>

<p>In a certain sense it may be said that the history of immigration
into the United States has been synonymous with
the history of the nation itself; but it is evident to all
unprejudiced minds, that the motives which induced those
early immigrants, the Pilgrim Fathers, to leave their native
land and settle in the New World, were very different from
the motives which actuate the greater numbers of those who
are pouring into the United States at the present day. In
fact, the time from the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers down
to the year which witnessed the inauguration of the first
President of the United States, may not unfitly be regarded
not as the period of immigration, but of colonization. Since
then the rapid growth of the population&mdash;though of course
largely due to natural causes&mdash;has been greatly accelerated
by immigration.</p>

<p>Immigration into the United States appears to come in
tidal waves. It has its flood and its ebb; but each decade,
with the exception of the war period, shows that the new
flood is higher than its predecessor. The magnitude of this
influx of alien immigrants is best shown by the Annual
Reports which have been issued by the late Board of Commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of Emigration of the State of New York. Without
troubling my readers with unnecessary statistics, I may say
briefly from calculations which have been made, the total
number of immigrant aliens who arrived at the port of New
York from the 5th May, 1847, until the 31st December,
1890 inclusive, was 10,050,936. It should be noted that
at least two-thirds of the whole number of alien immigrants
who come to the United States from other countries, arrive
at the port of New York.</p>

<p>This large influx has arisen from a variety of causes.
One of the most potent undoubtedly has been steamship
solicitation. A regular "brokerage" business has gradually
been established. Some of the steamship companies have
as many as two thousand agents in Europe, and their sub-agents
and solicitors are to be found in every district on the
Continent. These sub-agents receive liberal commissions,
varying from fifty cents to two dollars for each immigrant
passenger obtained. This naturally leads, not only to their
selling the tickets which are required, but also to their endeavouring
to create a fresh demand by solicitation and
inducement. These agents picture in the most glowing
terms to the poor peasants of Europe the future which
awaits them in the New World. On the strength of the
false representations made to them, the peasants are often
induced to sell out their little homes, and to spend a life's
savings in the purchase of a through passage to America.
Oftentimes they will even borrow money for the passage at
a ruinous rate, and the agents will advance the tickets,
taking a mortgage of whatever property is of value for payment.
In some cases the money is refunded, but in most
cases the agent becomes the owner of the property by
foreclosure; and the poor peasants in a few months find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
themselves and their families in a strange land, without
money, friends, or employment. Upon arrival, they are
taken in charge by a "labour boss," who herds them together
in a tenement house, and hires them out at wages he
dictates, and which he shares with his victims. Abundant
evidence was given before the Select Committee of the
House of Representatives, recently appointed to inquire
into immigration, as to the truth of these statements. For
instance, it appeared that one combination in Galicia induced
12,406 emigrants to emigrate to the United States
within the period of fourteen months.</p>

<p>Another and more indirect cause is the fierce competition
which rages among the steamship lines and the different
railroads. In 1888 a war of rates broke out among them,
so that in that year an emigrant could travel from Liverpool
to Chicago for ten dollars, or about two guineas in English
money. This low rate offered exceptional facilities to
foreign governments, poor-law guardians, and charitable
institutions, to rid themselves of the burden of persons
unable to support themselves and their families, by simply
purchasing for them tickets, and shipping them off to
America. The chief offender in this respect appears to
have been the British Government; and the Poor Law
Guardians in Ireland, who by the Land Act of 1881 were
advanced money to assist emigration, especially from the
poorer and more thickly populated districts of Ireland.
Various charitable societies in Europe and the United
Kingdom were no less active. The so-called "Tuke
Committee" assisted over 8000 persons to emigrate from
Ireland in three years, 1882-85. The Prisoners' Aid
Society also assisted convicts to emigrate, while the Central
Emigration Society and the Jewish Board of Guardians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
established in London, have both been active in sending
their paupers, and the least desirable portion of the population,
to America. Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, and Germany
also help to swell this alien invasion&mdash;Germany more especially
with regard to that most undesirable class of
emigrants, liberated criminals and discharged convicts.
There exists, for instance, in Munich, a society with several
branches, especially formed for the purpose of enabling
discharged convicts to begin life over again in some far-off
land, and the land almost invariably selected is the
United States.</p>

<p>Another method of evading the Contract Labour Law, and
of drawing large numbers of immigrants to the United States,
is the systematic advertising for labourers by employment
agencies through the British and European newspapers.
From evidence which came before the Select Committee
investigating at Boston, it appeared that the Freestone
Cutters' Association of New England had advertised in the
English and Scotch papers for journeymen, agreeing to pay
fifty cents per hour for work. The applicants were directed
to call upon the agents signing the advertisement in London.
These agents made no contract with the men, and so
evaded the letter of the Contract Labour Law; but they
came to New England on the representation that employment
should be found. As the freestone cutters in
England only get tenpence an hour, or about twenty cents
in American money, the prospect of largely increased wages
naturally induced many of them to go over to America.
This is only one instance out of many; and to quote the
Immigration Committee's Report, "Where good wages are
paid, advertisement abroad has become of common occurrence;
the workmen here are thereby brought to terms, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the market becomes overflooded with labourers, and wages
are reduced." In connection with this must also be considered
the immigration coming into the United States over
the Canadian border. During the last six months of 1890,
it is estimated that over 50,000 European immigrants landed
in Canada, and reached the United States, coming by this
circuitous route to avoid inspection. There is also another
point to be noted, viz. that large numbers of Canadians
come into the United States for work, wages being 40 per
cent. higher in the United States than in the Canadian
provinces. Several hundreds of these people cross over the
border from Windsor to Detroit every morning, and find
employment in the stores, seed-houses, and so forth, and
return to their homes every evening.</p>

<p>So much for the causes which have led to this wholesale
invasion. We will now consider its undesirable results.
The effect of immigration upon American labour is especially
marked. As was shown by the Report of the Ford
investigation of 1888, the pauper and lower classes of
Europe have crowded into the American factories to such
an extent, that in many of the large industries, notably the
cigar trade, tailoring trade, and the shirt manufacturing
trade, what was fifteen years ago 90 per cent. American
and 10 foreign, is now 90 per cent. foreign and 10 per
cent. American. Frequently upon differences arising between
employers and employed as to the price of wages,
foreigners were imported to take the place of American
workmen, and the wages were consequently reduced.
In fact, the tendency of foreign immigration is constantly
to lower the standard of wages which the American labourer
has hitherto enjoyed. The only persons opposed to restricting
it are the great manufacturers and contractors, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
interest is obviously to keep the price of labour at its
lowest level.</p>

<p>Another danger of indiscriminate immigration is plainly
shown in the riots which have taken place in New York and
other places during the last twenty-five years. In 1863, in
the city of New York, when the famous draft riots took
place, no American dared to display the flag of his country
without running the risk of having his house burned and
destroyed. Recent outbreaks of Nihilists, Anarchists, and
Socialists, in the city of Chicago, and the still more recent
lynchings at New Orleans, are further illustrations of my
meaning. This political danger is deepened by the short
period of time in which immigrants may become eligible for
citizenship, and thus invested with political power. In
several States the immigrant is admitted to citizenship after
only one year's residence, and while he is still to a great
extent ignorant of the laws, language, and customs. The
right of citizenship thus conferred is very liable to be
abused. American politicians, like other politicians, are
very prone to yield to their prejudices without sufficiently
regarding the interests of the people at large. The German
vote in many localities controls the action of political
leaders on the liquor question. The Irish vote favours,
and largely influences, the policy of antagonism to Great
Britain.</p>

<p>The social effects of this increasing immigration are also
very strongly marked. There is an abnormal representation
of the foreign poor in the workhouses and penitentiaries of
the United States; and there can be little doubt that the
effect of deporting to America the destitute, the worthless,
and the criminal, has largely added to the burden there of
pauperism, vice, and crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>How keenly alive American statesmen are to the evils
which result from unrestricted immigration, is shown by a
perusal of the Acts which have been passed upon the
subject. The Acts, other than those regulating the immigration
of Chinese labourers, are three in number, viz.:&mdash;The
Act to regulate immigration approved by Congress in
1882, the Contract Labour Law of 1885, and the recent
Act to amend all previous laws, which was approved by
Congress on the 3rd of March of this year, and which came
into force on the 1st of April last.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> I do not propose to dwell
upon the provisions of those Acts in detail; they are given
in full elsewhere;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> but section 1 of the new Act, which
specifies the class of aliens henceforth to be excluded from
the United States, deserves to be quoted in full:&mdash;"All
idiots, insane persons; paupers, or persons likely to become
a public charge; persons suffering from a loathsome or a
dangerous contagious disease; persons who have been convicted
of felony or other infamous crime or misdemeanour
involving moral turpitude, polygamists, and also any persons
whose ticket or passage is paid for with the money
of another, or who is assisted by others to come." The
right of asylum to political and religious refugees is maintained
intact by the insertion of a special proviso. The
working of the Act is very simple. The immigrants are
stopped at the port of arrival and inspected, and the steamship
companies are compelled to take back at their own
expense all those who are refused admission; and heavy
penalties of fine and imprisonment are dealt out to those
who attempt to break or to evade the law. This course of
action, though it may seem to press hardly in individual
cases, has been found to have an excellent deterrent effect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for as soon as steamship companies know that they bring
over such passengers at their own risk, they refuse to bring
them at all, and the evil to a great extent is nipped in the
bud.</p>

<p>Now, if such measures of self-defence have become thus
early in her history imperative with a young country like
America, with a habitable area of <em>more than 3,000,000
square miles</em>, and a population of not more than 65,000,000,
what are we to think of an old country like England, with
an area of <em>a little over 32,000,000 acres</em>, and a population,
according to the census of 1881, of near 25,000,000 souls&mdash;and
probably of over 30,000,000 now&mdash;compelled to
spend annually some £7,000,000 on the relief or support
of her own three-quarters of a million of paupers&mdash;leaving
her ports, more especially the port of London, free for the
entrance of a huge foreign and degraded population, from
every country in Europe, which statistics demonstrate to be
largely on the increase?</p>

<p>It is impossible for Englishmen not to feel a certain
amount of envy at the energy and firmness which the
American Government has displayed in excluding undesirable
aliens. If such action be good, where the vast
territories of the United States are in question, what must
be thought of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</i> policy which allows our little
British Islands to be overrun by the class of foreigner which
America so rigorously excludes?</p>

<br />THE COLONIAL ASPECT.</h2>


<p>In this chapter I propose not only to deal with the
general laws for restricting destitute and undesirable immigration
into some of the principal colonies, but also the
particular laws for prohibiting the immigration of Chinese.
Sir Charles Dilke, in a general summary of colonial policy on
this matter, writes:&mdash;"Colonial labour seeks protection by
legislative means, not only against the cheap labour of the
dark-skinned or of the yellow man, but also against white
paupers, and against the artificial supply of labour by State-aided
white immigration. Most of the countries of the
world, indeed, have laws against the admission of destitute
aliens, and the United Kingdom is in practice almost the
only exception."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The main object of all the general laws passed upon the
subject appears to be the same, namely, to prevent the
colonies from becoming the "dumping-ground" of the
destitute, lunatic, vicious, and criminal population of older
countries, including in several instances the mother country
as well. With regard to Chinese immigration, two objects
are apparent: first, to protect the native population from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
foreign competition in the different branches of industry,
the effect of which is materially to lower wages, and reduce
the standard of comfort of the colonial artisan or labourer;
and secondly, to guard against the political dangers which
the presence of a numerous alien race occupying an inferior
position could not fail to bring about.</p>

<p>To take the general laws first. The principal colonies
which have passed statutes on the subject are Canada,
Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand.
In New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, the
Cape Colony, and Natal, there are no similar statutes; but
these colonies have the power, in the case of a threatened
influx of undesirable immigrants, of passing restraining Acts,
which effectually meet the purpose for which they are required.
I now give a summary of the principal general
statutes actually passed, other than those which exist for the
immigration of Chinese. They are given in more detail
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In Canada, the Immigration Act of 1886 enacts that the
Governor-General may by proclamation prohibit the landing
of destitute, pauper, or diseased immigrants; also of the
criminal and vicious; and arrangements are made for the
immediate return of the vessel and the prohibited immigrants
to the port of Europe whence they came.</p>

<p>In Victoria, the owner of the ship is compelled to give a
bond of £100 to the immigration officer for every passenger
he may bring, being "either lunatic, idiotic, deaf, dumb,
blind, or infirm, or likely in his opinion to become a charge
upon the public, or upon any public or charitable institution."
Penalties are enacted for refusing to execute the bond,
which, it should be noted, is applicable to the master of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
<em>British</em> or foreign navigable vessel; the only exemption
being in favour of crews that are shipwrecked, or her
Majesty's land and sea forces.</p>

<p>By the Immigration Act of South Australia, passed in
1872, paupers are practically forbidden to land. In Tasmania,
the Passengers Act, 1885, enacts in the same way as
Victoria, that a bond of £100 shall be given to the collector
at the port of arrival, by the master of any ship (except one
plying from one port in the colony to any other), who
attempts to land any passenger in Tasmania, being "either
lunatic, idiotic, deaf, dumb, blind, or infirm, or from any
cause unable to support himself, or likely to become a
charge upon the public." As in Victoria, the bond is applied
to the maintenance of the said passenger, and penalties are
enforced in the case of the refusal to execute it. Provisions
are also made with regard to ships undergoing quarantine.
In New Zealand, the "Imbecile Passengers Act" of 1882
is practically identical with that of Tasmania.</p>

<p>Such are the principal general Colonial Acts.</p>

<p>We now come to the vexed question of Chinese Immigration.
It would be well to mention in passing that a
particularly drastic Act was passed in British Columbia in
1884, which spoke of the "pestilential habits" of the
Chinese, and stated that they "habitually desecrate graveyards
by the removal of bodies therefrom." These expressions
were termed "peculiarly offensive" by the Chinese
Ambassador in London; but apparently his protest was of
no avail, for in 1885 another and still more drastic Act was
passed, which effectually prohibited all further Chinese immigration
to British Columbia. It is, however, with Chinese
immigration into Australasia that we are more immediately
concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>For many years the immigration of Chinese into Australia
was very large, causing great irritation throughout the
colonies, more especially among the working-classes, who
thus found the price of their labour undersold. Many
attempts, more or less successful, were made for the purpose
of restricting the undesirable influx. In 1887 Commissioners
were dispatched by the Emperor of China to the Australasian
colonies, for the purpose of inquiring into the condition of
the Chinese residing therein. These Commissioners found
that in each of the colonies they visited, a poll-tax of £10
was imposed upon Chinese subjects, from which the subjects
of other powers were exempted, and also that various laws
had been enacted by some of the Colonial Legislatures
against the Chinese. Upon receiving this report, a complaint
was forthwith lodged at the Foreign Office by the
Chinese Minister accredited to the Court of St. James's,
pointing out that these restrictions and laws were at variance
with treaty obligations and international usage. Upon
receipt of this protest, Lord Salisbury communicated with
Lord Knutsford, with the result that a circular letter was
dispatched from the Colonial Office to the Governors of all
the Australasian colonies, enclosing a copy of the letter
from the Chinese Minister, and requesting to be furnished
with full information on the subject.</p>

<p>The receipt of this circular created quite a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">furore</i> in
Australia, where public opinion was already greatly excited
on the subject. The replies received in answer to it were
numerous and varied; but one dominant note sounded
through all of them, namely, that at all hazards the Chinese
must be restricted from emigrating to any part of Australasia.</p>

<p>The Despatch prepared by the Ministers of New South
Wales, and telegraphed to the Colonial Office by Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Carrington, who was then Governor, is of especial interest.
It deserves to be quoted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i>, since it sums up the
whole case in favour of the colonies.</p>

<p>"Australian feeling is much exercised in reference to
Chinese immigration and the inquiry made by the Marquis
of Salisbury,"&mdash;so runs the Despatch.&mdash;"Your Excellency's
advisers beg chiefly to explain that the law of the colony for
some years past has imposed the restrictions of a poll-tax of
£10 on each immigrant, and a limitation of one immigrant
to every hundred tons of the ship's burden; but owing to
recent occurrences, severer measures are now demanded
throughout all the colonies. This state of things has
given rise to new reflections in dealing with a difficulty
which threatens to become a calamity. As these colonies
form an important part of the Empire, it is submitted that
our cause of contention is of sufficient national concern to be
taken up by the Empire; if we have no voice in the making
of treaties, it seems only just that our interests should be
considered and exercised by those who exercise that power.
We learn by public report that the United States Government
have entered into a treaty with the Government of
China, by which Chinese immigration into America is no
longer permitted. We fail to see why Australia may not be
similarly protected. On behalf of this colony we desire,
through your Excellency, to impress upon her Majesty's Imperial
advisers the more prominent phases of the Chinese
question, as it specially and almost exclusively affects the
Australian section of the British people. Firstly, the Australian
ports are within easy sail of the ports of China; secondly, the
climate, as well as certain branches of trade and industry in
Australia, such as the cultivation of the soil for domestic
purposes, and tin and gold mining, are peculiarly attractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to the Chinese; thirdly, the working-classes of the British
people, in all the affinities of race, are directly opposed to
their Chinese competitors; fourthly, there can be no
sympathy, and in the future it is to be apprehended that
there will be no peace, between the two races; fifthly, the
enormous number of the Chinese population intensifies
every consideration of this class of immigration in comparison
with the immigration of any other nation; sixthly, the
most prevailing determination in all the Australian communities
is to preserve the British type in the population;
seventhly, there can be no interchange of ideas of religion
or citizenship, nor can there be any intermarriage or social
communion, between the British and the Chinese. It is
respectfully admitted that the examination of these principal
phases of the question can only lead to one conclusion,
namely, that the Chinese must be restricted from emigrating
to any part of Australasia. It will be seen that while the
question scarcely touches the people of the United Kingdom,
it vitally concerns these great colonies, whose importance
in their political and commercial relations entitles
them to be protected by the diplomatic influence and the
powers of treaty which belong to the Empire. With renewed
expressions of our loyal attachment to her Majesty, we
urge that immediate steps be taken to open such negotiations
with the Emperor of China as will result in affording
permanent security to the Australian colonies from the
disturbance of Chinese immigration in any form; the
matter is too grave and urgent to admit of long delay.
However desirable it may be to avoid the irritation and
conflict of interests which may arise from local legislation
of a drastic character, if protection cannot be afforded as
now sought, the Australian Parliaments must act from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
force of public opinion in devising measures to defend
the colonies from consequences which they cannot relax in
their efforts to avert."</p>

<p>This representation on the part of New South Wales was
followed by similar ones from all the Colonial Governments
to whom the circular had been addressed. From Victoria
came an intimation stating the statutes already in force, and
the intention of the Victorian Government to carry out the
law to its utmost letter.</p>

<p>From Queensland, the Government wrote to say that they
were determined to restrict the influx of Chinese, because it
had been proved by experience that they had become formidable
competitors with European labour in almost every branch
of industry; some branches, such as cabinet-making, having
been practically monopolized by them in several of the
Australian cities. And, as owing to their habits of life, the
cost of subsistence was to the Chinese very much less than
to Europeans living in accordance with European habits; and
the effect of their unrestricted competition was undoubtedly
to materially lower wages, and to reduce the standard of
comfort to European artisans and labourers. There was
also the insuperable objection that the Chinese could not
be admitted to an equal share in the political and social
institutions of the colony; and under the present colonial
system every citizen is allowed to have a voice in the
government of his country; and the presence, in considerable
numbers, of an alien race occupying an inferior position
could not fail before long to bring about very serious
troubles, which would probably necessitate a radical change
in political institutions, and entirely alter the future history
and development of Australia.</p>

<p>Despatches were also received from New Zealand, Tasmania,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Western Australia, and in fact all the Australasian
colonies, stating that the greatest excitement prevailed upon
this question, and that there was a general determination to
prevent the continued immigration of Chinese.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this was that in June of the same year
a conference of representatives of the Australian Governments
of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland,
Tasmania, and Western Australia, was held at Sydney, with
the result that the poll-tax which had given so much offence
to the Chinese Government was remitted, but a number of
resolutions were passed which have since been embodied in
the different Chinese Immigrant Acts and statutes, which
amended all the previous Acts which had been passed on
the subject. It is unnecessary to quote these Acts in detail,
but their provisions may be briefly summarized, as limiting
the number of Chinese to be brought to the colonies by
vessel; increasing the penalties for violation of the law; and
prohibiting alien Chinese from voting at elections of the
local authority of the colony. Certain exceptions are made
in the case of Chinese immigrants who are British subjects,
of certain Chinese officials, and of the crews of vessels who
do not land in the colony.</p>

<p>These Acts, which are now in force, have been found
very effectual for the purpose for which they were required.
The action of the Colonies in this matter did not meet with
the approval of the Colonial Office; but since it was evident
that the Colonies were determined to prevent Chinese immigration
at all hazards, no further word of remonstrance was
heard from Downing Street.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the point affecting labour upon
which colonial workmen felt most strongly, and upon which
they are thoroughly agreed, is the desire to discourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
emigration. Colonial labour seeks protection by legislative
means, not only against Chinese, but also, as we have seen,
against the artificial supply of labour by State-aided immigration,
and other means. The colonial workmen are opposed
not only to the reception of the destitute from abroad, but
even to the assisted emigration of persons able to work.
They argue that if assisted English emigration is encouraged,
inferior workmen will come out to the colonies, and bring
down wages to the European level.</p>

<p>The agitation against the Chinese in particular, however,
is no new thing. So far back as 1854 the second Governor
of Victoria reported to the Home Government that he
thought the introduction of the Chinese into Australia undesirable.
"Australia for the Australian" has for a long
time been the prevailing cry; and to that may be added,
"Canada for the Canadian." Colonial labour, whether in
Canada or Australasia, desires to limit competition. The
Chinaman is a most dangerous competitor. He is an
excellent workman, but at a very low standard of comfort.
The colonial artisan, on the other hand, has a much higher
standard of comfort than the ordinary European labourer.
His pay is high, and his hours are short. He is educated,
and he is independent. He has plenty of leisure for
amusement, and he regards all his privileges as rights, and
he fully intends to keep them. We cannot blame him
either; and it cannot be said that he takes a purely selfish
view of the case, since in the Dockers' Strike the Australian
workmen sent large sums to England where no return was
possible.</p>

<p>After all, the Chinese are only a small population in our
white colonies; but this is because of the difficulties which
have been thrown in the way of their coming in. Were it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
not for this, they would be numerous indeed. The Blue-book
of July 1888, as we have seen, shows how determined the
Colonies are to forbid Chinese immigration at all hazards.
Their action in this matter has been in many respects
contrary to the letter of the law; but as Sir Henry Parkes,
the Premier of New South Wales, said, when charged by
the Assembly for having broken the law, "I care nothing
about your cobweb of technical law; I am obeying a law
far superior to any law which issued these permits, namely,
the law for the preservation of society in New South Wales."</p>

<p>The Australian Intercolonial Conference had declared the
Chinese to be "an alien race, incapable of assimilation in
the body politic"; and acting upon these conclusions, Sir
Henry Parkes declared&mdash;"Neither for her Majesty's ships of
war, nor for her Majesty's representative on the spot, nor
for her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, do we
intend to turn aside from our purpose." Lord Knutsford
telegraphed to know by what law New South Wales shut
out the Chinese; and the reply which he received, in effect
was, that both laws and treaties must give way to the
strength of colonial feeling. After that, the Imperial
Government did well to be silent, for to have enforced the
law, or to have enforced the treaties, would have been to
have risked an open rupture between the Colonies and the
mother country. This anti-Chinese feeling is often spoken of
as another phase of protection; but it is worthy of note
that Sir Henry Parkes, whose vigorous utterances I have
quoted above, is a free-trader.</p>

<p>Such in brief are the principal colonial laws on this
subject, both in a general sense, and more particularly with
regard to Chinese immigration. These laws are the legislative
outcome of the almost passionate demands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
colonists. The significant fact is, that unlike the mother
country, the Colonies cannot bring forward the plea of overpopulation,
since in all of them there are vast tracts of
territory still uninhabited, and in Australia only the fringe
of the vast continent is at present populated. Yet in their
own interests the Colonies have found it necessary to pass
such stringent laws as those described. The moral is
obvious. If young countries like our Colonies, which
require a large working population, find it necessary to
shut out the destitute, the unfit, and the undesirable&mdash;and
are able to do so with the greatest possible success&mdash;surely
the mother country, where there are already too many
mouths to fill, may be expected to follow their example.</p>

<br />THE REMEDIES.</h2>


<p>In this chapter let us very briefly consider the best
way in which this wrong may be set right. Several suggestions
have been made for dealing with this question
apart from legislation; some of them have been acted
upon, but none seem to go to the root of the evil. Among
these well-meaning but unsuccessful efforts, may be classed
the recent action of the Government in causing notices to
be posted up at some of the principal European ports,
warning intended immigrants of the state of the labour
market here, and of the hardships that await them. This
sounds very well in theory, but in practice it may be
doubted if it has had the effect of stopping one single
immigrant from proceeding on his journey. For in nine
cases out of ten, that journey is already nearly accomplished
before the notice catches his eye. A Russian Jew, for
instance, who had travelled all the way from the heart
of Russia to Hamburg, would hardly be likely to turn back
at the eleventh hour. What is there for him to do but to
go forward all the same? He has made all his preparations,
broken up his home, sold his little stock, and
perhaps expended a life's savings in the purchase of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
through ticket to that new land where he has been told all
good things are; and by the time he reaches the port it is
too late for him to turn back even if he could. But would
he if he could? I very much doubt it. "Whatever happens,"
he may argue, "things cannot be much worse with me than
they have been." Besides, he may have the direct, or indirect,
promise of employment through some sweater's agent, or he
may have heard&mdash;such news travels fast&mdash;of the "shelters,"
of the relief-funds, of the soup-kitchens, of the loan and
industrial departments of the Jewish Board of Guardians,
and of the numerous foreign "Benevolent Societies," or of
other similar charitable organizations for foreigners in distress,
which abound in London. The Chief Commissioner of the
Police writes in his Report<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>:&mdash;"It cannot be ascertained
that any societies are in existence in London to offer direct
inducements to immigrants; <em>but, undoubtedly the prospect of
shelter and assistance till work is obtained, which some hold
out, acts as an indirect inducement to many</em>."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> "Whatever
happens," the immigrant argues to himself, "I shall not
actually starve." He proceeds on his journey, notices and
warnings notwithstanding, and in due time arrives here,
one more unit to intensify the awful struggle for existence
which is daily and hourly going on among thousands in
London and our large provincial cities.</p>

<p>What, then, is the remedy?</p>

<p>The answer is simple. In the words of the Select Committee
upon Immigration&mdash;"It is clear that the only way
effectually to check the immigration of foreign paupers
is to stop them at the port of arrival." This is the course
adopted in the United States and in Germany. The police
regulations at Hamburg are to the effect that no person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
without means is allowed to land at that port; and if found
to have been taken there and landed, the captain of the
vessel in which the person sailed, is liable to a penalty
of 300 marks, and moreover is compelled at his own
expense to take the destitute person away from Hamburg.
As we have already seen, in the United States and our
principal colonies, similar laws exist to forbid the landing
of destitute and undesirable aliens, while other European
countries have also taken steps to guard themselves against
them. Though the details may vary in particular instances,
the principle in all cases remains the same. England could
not do better than adopt some similar plan, and compel the
steamship companies to take back to the place where they
first took them on board, all persons whom they attempted
to land at our ports, who were unprovided with the means
of subsistence, mentally or bodily afflicted, or likely in any
way to become a public nuisance or a public burden. But
it will require a special Act of Parliament to compel the
steamship companies to do this, and every effort should be
made to get such an Act placed upon the statute-book. The
mere knowledge that such a law existed would exercise an
excellent deterrent effect, and serve to keep away thousands
and thousands from our shores; for directly the steamship
companies knew that they brought such passengers at their
own risk, they would speedily cease bringing them at all,
and would exercise that same circumspection in bringing
people here, which they now have to exercise in the case of
other countries.</p>

<p>Such, I submit, would be an effectual remedy. It has
much to recommend it from a practical point of view. It is
no visionary scheme; it has been tested by experience in
other countries, and has been found to work admirably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Why should it not work equally well here? But at the
same time it is idle to deny, having regard to the present
state of public business, and to the fact that the life of
the present Parliament is ebbing fast, that any legislation on
this subject must of necessity be tardy. In the meantime
there is much to be done. That the working-classes of this
country are already alive to the danger may be seen in a
moment by glancing at the long list of Trades Unions and
labour organizations which have already condemned it.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
But that the other classes which make up the electorate are
equally convinced of its urgency may be doubted, and the
reason is obvious&mdash;it does not touch them so nearly. Therefore,
no opportunity should be lost of bringing the real facts
of the case before the public. With this object the present
little book has been written, and if it should have the effect
of causing any to pause and consider the importance of this
question, the reason for its existence will have been more
than justified.</p>

<p>"There is a general agreement that pauper immigration
is an evil, and should be checked." This much was
admitted by the House of Commons' Committee in their
Report, and they went on to say that "the objections to
such a proposal are not based on grounds of policy in any
instance, but upon the difficulty of carrying such a measure
into effect." Furthermore, they admitted that though they
were not prepared to recommend legislative interference just
at present, because of the "great difficulties" in the way,
yet "they contemplated the possibility of such legislation
becoming necessary in the future, in view of the crowded
condition of our great towns, the extreme pressure for existence
among the poorer part of the population, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
tendency of destitute foreigners to reduce still lower the
social and material condition of our own poor."</p>

<p>This Report was issued in 1889. Little more than two
years have elapsed since its publication, and already it must
be admitted the danger has greatly increased. It may be
asked&mdash;Are the difficulties which surround this question
likely to become less by waiting for the future? Are they
not rather liable to become greater as time goes on, and the
evils lamented by the Committee assume more formidable
aspects? To admit the existence of an evil, to deplore its
effects, and yet to shrink from proposing any remedy
because there are difficulties in the way, is a very lame
and impotent conclusion. Such a proceeding may or may
not agree with the political exigencies of the moment, may
or may not be desirable from a party point of view; but it
shows a deplorable lack of the courage of conviction, and
of the higher order of statesmanship. A problem which
other nations under similar circumstances have successfully
solved, is surely not one from which English statesmen
should shrink, because of the difficulties besetting its
solution.</p>

<p>Let us analyse these difficulties. One, we are frequently
told, is the short sea passage between the Continent and
England, which would render it practically impossible for
us to adopt a similar plan to that already existing in other
countries. But if at Hamburg they can effectually prevent
the landing of destitute persons from England, surely in
England we can prevent the landing of destitute persons
from Hamburg&mdash;the port from which the great bulk of
these objectionable aliens generally come? The difficulty
in the one case is no greater than the difficulty in the other.
That objection is easily disposed of. But the other impediment&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
lack of trustworthy statistics&mdash;is more serious,
since without statistics there can be no legislation. I have
already alluded to the Board of Trade Returns, and have
endeavoured to show how utterly worthless they are for all
practical purposes. The same dearth of information was the
great stumbling-block in the way of the House of Commons'
Committee. To that, its chairman, Sir William Marriot, has
testified.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> "The difficulty was," he said, "that there was no
means of getting correct information; and it was a most
extraordinary thing, that, though we had some witnesses from
the Board of Trade, they were utterly unaware of certain Acts
of Parliament which ought to be carried out by them, namely,
the Act of William IV.; and we discovered that, although
the people were calling for fresh legislation, there was a law
existing by which we could get information at every port in
England." Such was the state of affairs then. It is not
much better now. Returns are not taken from every port
in England; important ones&mdash;Southampton for instance&mdash;being
still omitted; those from three of the most important
ports are only partial; and from all they are loosely prepared,
only checked "now and then," and the penalties for
violation of the Act are never enforced. How can such
returns be considered satisfactory? If they really want us
to know the exact dimensions of the extent of alien immigration,
there can be no difficulty in the way. The Act
exists; it is only for the Government to put it into force;
it is only a question of method, of means, and of men. But
if they do not want us to know, that is another matter, and
pressure should be brought to bear until the required
information is forthcoming.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<p>Such then is the remedy, such are the difficulties in the
way of its being applied. They are easily surmounted.
The real <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crux</i> of the question is this. Is such a remedy
justified by the circumstances of the disease? I submit,
for reasons already given, that it is. State intervention is an
extreme measure; as a rule it is better to let natural laws
take their course, to see what can be done by individual
effort, mutual help, organization, and combination. Men
of the school of thought of Mr. Herbert Spencer and Mr.
Auberon Herbert would probably denounce such a measure
as "socialistic," in that it would limit the freedom of the
individual, and limit the utility of his individual capital by
forbidding him to employ it in certain ways. I admit the
plausibility of their strictures in many instances, but not in
this one. The key-note of such a measure as that which I
have indicated, would be to help the weak, and to protect
those who are not able to help themselves. Speaking
generally, I am not a believer in what is termed "grandmotherly
legislation." You cannot make men sober, religious,
industrious, or moral by Acts of Parliament. The
experiment has been tried, and failed. But you can at
least remove all the stumbling-blocks in the way of their
becoming so. In this particular instance, individual effort
has been tried and failed. It has been found to be useless
in stemming the tide of pauperism and degradation which
pours in upon us from abroad. Therefore, in the last
extremity, we resort to the State as the natural protector of
our people.</p>

<p>It has been urged as an objection to such a measure that
it would violate the principles of Free Trade. The fact that
this movement is supported by many whose fidelity to Free
Trade principles is above suspicion, is a sufficient answer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that objection.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But even were it otherwise&mdash;what then?
Free Trade is not a fetish. It was made for man, and not
man for it. There is no such thing as Free Trade in
human bodies. You cannot argue that the economic laws
which are applicable to goods should govern man. You
cannot confuse humanity with commodities. You may
exclude commodities by a tariff if you please&mdash;that is not
an immoral principle. You may let in commodities freely
if you choose; but to let in human bodies to compete with
those who are natives of the soil, who are your flesh and
blood, and who already have the greatest difficulty in supporting
life&mdash;to allow this, because to shut them out would
be violating the principle of Free Trade, is to sacrifice a
principle to a name.</p>

<p>Lastly, it has been said that to prohibit the destitute and
unfit of other countries would be a dangerous and a mischievous
innovation. Prohibition in itself is no innovation.
We already prohibit many things which tend to our national
hurt&mdash;false coins, disease in animals, in special shapes in
human beings, products dangerous to life and limb, besides
various things touching our revenue. Prohibition, therefore,
in this instance, would only be extended in a fresh direction.
Nor can it be declared contrary to the laws of the land or
the principles of the Constitution. Such an objection is
founded upon ignorance, and not on fact. The Alien Acts
of the Plantagenets and early Tudors; the Proclamation of
Mary against the French, of Elizabeth against the Scots;
the Peace Alien Acts, and the War Alien Acts of the
Georgian era; and, in a lesser degree, the Chartist Act of
the present reign&mdash;a perusal of these will tend to convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
any dispassionate student of our history, that while this
country has always been desirous of welcoming the persecuted
and oppressed of other lands, national interests have
ever been deemed to have the prior claim. I do not wish
to go over again the arguments already adduced in favour
of some judicious restrictive measure. To do so would be
to weary and not to edify. It will suffice, in conclusion,
to say that they may all be summed up in the memorable
words of Sir George Grey, when introducing the Chartist
Act of 1848:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The grounds on which it is proposed, are simply those
which this country has always maintained, and has every
right to maintain, namely, that of self-protection."</p>

<br />SOME OBSOLETE ALIEN ACTS.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></h2>


<h3>STATUTES OF RICHARD II.</h3>

<p>In 1390, by a statute of Richard II., it was declared "That
no alien person should trade without proof given that he
would expend half the value of his merchandise in other
merchandise here."</p>

<p>In 1392, after stating that the Free Trade Acts of Edward
III. were a great hindrance and damage to cities of the
realm, it was declared that "no foreign merchant shall sell
or buy within the realm to any other foreign merchant to
sell again. That no foreign merchant should sell at retail
within the realm, except provisions, and as to some provisions
only in large quantities."</p>


<h3>ACT OF HENRY IV.</h3>

<p>This Act was followed in 1402 (Henry IV.), by provisions
forbidding any carrying of the proceeds of such trade out
of the country, except in the shape of other merchandise
bought in exchange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>


<h3>ACT OF HENRY VI. <i>re</i> "HOSTS."</h3>

<p>By an Act of 1439 (Henry VI., not repealed until this
century), it was enacted, "That all alien merchants shall be
under the survey of certain persons, to be called Hosts or
surveyors, to be appointed by the mayors of the several
cities, and to be good and creditable natives expert in
merchandise; such Hosts to be privy to all sales and contracts
of the aliens. Aliens to sell all their merchandise
within six months on paying a forfeiture. The Hosts to
keep books only to register all contracts, etc., of aliens, and
deliver a transcript thereto to the Exchequer. The Hosts
to have two shillings in the pound on all such contracts,
and to be sworn to be faithful, and any alien refusing to
submit to these regulations, to be imprisoned until security
be given to comply with them."</p>


<h3>ACT OF RICHARD III.</h3>

<p>In 1543, in the reign of Richard III., it was enacted&mdash;"That
no person not born under the King's obeysance shall
exercise or occupy any handicraft, or the occupation of any
handicraftsman, in this realm of England; and shall (after
date then fixed) depart into their own country again; or
else be servants of such of the King's subjects only as be
expert and cunning in such feats, wits, and crafts, which the
said stranger can occupy."</p>


<h3>PROCLAMATION HENRY VII. EXPULSION OF SCOTS.</h3>

<p>In the reign of Henry VII. 1491, when the death of
James III. of Scotland had strained the relations between
the two kingdoms, an Act was passed simply in these words&mdash;"All
Scots, not made denizens, shall depart this realm within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
forty days after proclamation, upon paying a forfeiture of
all their goods."</p>


<h3>MARY I. EXPULSION OF THE FRENCH.</h3>

<p>In the reign of Queen Mary there is a Statute against the
French, which also directed their departure from the realm,
and based it by the preamble not only on political grounds,
but because the influx of such strangers tended to the
diminishing of subjects of the realm, and the treasury of the
sovereign.</p>


<h3>ELIZABETH.</h3>

<p>By simple proclamation Elizabeth expelled the Scots.</p>


<h3>ALIEN ACTS OF THE GEORGIAN ERA.</h3>

<p>Provisions as to aliens in the Georgian and Victorian eras
are of three kinds&mdash;(<i>a</i>) War Alien Acts; (<i>b</i>) Peace Alien Acts;
(<i>c</i>) Registration Acts. The Alien Acts contain regulations
for expulsion of aliens, if the State requires it. In war time
it is more stringent. All these Acts contain provisions as to
registration. The history of these Acts briefly is as follows:&mdash;In
1793 (the French Revolution) first Alien Act, which being
of a stringent character became the model. War Alien
Act; this continued with amendments until the Peace of
Amiens, 1802. Then for a year there was a Peace Alien
Act, followed in the following year by a War Alien Act,
when the Peninsular War began. With the French Restoration
there was in 1814 a Peace Alien Act, followed again
in the year ensuing by a War Alien Act, with the temporary
restoration of the French Empire, and again by a Peace
Alien Act, when the power of Napoleon was finally crushed.
This last Statute was renewed by biennial Continuance Acts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
until in 1826 expulsion clauses were entirely removed, and
registration only remained.</p>


<h3>CHARTIST ACT, 1848.</h3>

<p>The registration was modified by the Alien Act of
William IV. in 1836, and the only interruption to its course
has been the Chartist Act of 1848, which was an Expulsion
Act, passed for one year.</p>

<p class="center">LAW FORBIDDING THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN IN
<br />VAGRANT PROFESSIONS, DEC. 21, 1873.</p>

<p>Article 1.&mdash;Whoever should entrust, or under any plea
should deliver, to Italian subjects or to aliens, persons of either
sex under the age of 18, although children or under the
guardianship of the persons entrusting them, and whoever,
whether Italian subjects or aliens, should receive them for the
purpose of employing them within the kingdom in any way and
under any name in the exercise of vagrant professions such as
jugglers, conjurers, clowns, itinerant players or singers, tight-rope
dancers, diviners of dreams, exhibitors of animals, mendicants,
and such like, shall be punished with imprisonment
from one to three months, and with a fine from 51 to 250 lire.</p>

<p>Article 2.&mdash;Whoever within the kingdom should keep with
him in the exercise of the said vagrant professions persons

100 to 500 lire.</p>

<p>Article 3.&mdash;Whoever should entrust, or deliver, within the
State, or should take abroad for the purpose of entrusting or
delivering to Italian subjects or aliens, persons under the age
of 18, although children or under the guardianship of the
persons entrusting them; and whoever, whether an Italian
subject or alien, should receive such minors in order to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
them, entrust, or deliver them abroad for the purpose of employing
them in any way and under any name in the exercise
of the before-said vagrant professions, shall be punished with
imprisonment from six months to a year, and with a fine from

foreign State, in the exercise of the before-said vagrant professions,
persons of Italian nationality, under the age of 18,
shall be punished with imprisonment from one to two years,
and a fine from 500 to 1000 lire.</p>

<p>If it should appear from the proceedings that the minor had
been abandoned, or that he had seriously suffered in health
through want of food, bad treatment, or ill-usage, or had on
that account to turn away or abscond from the person in whose
charge he was, the imprisonment may be extended to three
years.</p>

<p>Article 5.&mdash;This article treats of persons who should take
these minors by violence or fraud for the purpose of employing
them as above, in which case the punishment may be as much
as seven years' imprisonment.</p>

of fine, for parents or guardians who have entrusted minors for
the above purpose, to declare them to the Mayor of the town
in which they reside in Italy, or to the Diplomatic or Consular
Authorities, if abroad, within three months from the date of
the law.</p>

<br />in European countries.)</p>

<p>(Translation.)</p>

<h3>LAW ON FOREIGNERS AND TRAVELLERS.</h3>

<p>We, Christian IX., &amp;c., make known the Rigsdag has passed,
and we with our approval confirm, the following Law:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Passports abolished, but may be required of inhabitants of
countries in which Danish travellers are obliged to be furnished
with them.</p>

<p>Residence in the country forbidden to foreign gipsies,
musicians, exhibitors of animals, &amp;c., acrobats and conjurers,
and such like persons, gaining their livelihood by wandering
about. Entry into the country forbidden also to all foreigners
in search of work, unless they are provided with a document of
identity from a public functionary.</p>

<p>2. Foreigners who are not possessed of any claim for maintenance
in this country, and are destitute of the necessary
means of subsistence, as well as those who, under the provisions
of Article 1, are not allowed to settle in the country, shall be as
soon as possible sent out of it, or turned out of it by the police.
In connection herewith an injunction can be given by police
certificate to the party concerned not to allow himself to be
found again in the country, with a notification of his liability
under Article 22 if he violates the order.</p>

<p>3. Foreigners not in possession of right of maintenance in the
country, who seek to support themselves by manual or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
bodily labour, either as servants or, without legalizing themselves
as travelling artisans, by any species of work necessitating
journies from place to place, have to announce themselves to
the Chief of the Police in whose jurisdiction they arrive, or as
soon afterwards as they set about seeking such means of
existence, to the Chief of the Police in whose jurisdiction they
are resident at the time.</p>

<p>4. The Chief of the Police to whom application is made
under the preceding Article, shall investigate whether the party
is in a condition in which it can be reasonably expected that he
can and will support himself in this country by lawful labour;
he must in this connection look carefully into the accuracy of
the documents of identity which the applicant exhibits; and
also exact assurance that the applicant is either guaranteed
work or service, or is in possession of sufficient means to
provide himself with subsistence on a modest scale for eight
days, and afterwards to leave the country.</p>

<p>Should the Chief of Police, after this examination, find that
extended residence can be conceded to the applicant, he shall
provide him with a residence-book, prescribed by the instructions
of, and at the price fixed by, the Ministry of Justice,
in the drawing up of which book provision is made for the
certifying of the documents of identity; in the contrary event
care must be taken to send or remove the applicant out of the
country.</p>

<p>The foregoing provisions are also to be applied to all
foreigners mentioned in Article 3, who, at the period when the
present Law comes into operation, are found resident in the
country without having procured means of subsistence, an
allowance of one month being made to them in which to notify
themselves to the Chief of Police in the place of their residence.
Should they be provided with a journey-book, mark shooting-book,
or other document of identity, they receive a residence-book,
delivered at the cost of the police fund, in which the
certificate of their documents of identity are set forth. In the
residence-book it is notified that it is given in place of the former
document of identity, which the applicant must nevertheless
preserve, and produce when required to do so.</p>

<p>5. Any one in possession of a residence-book who shall wish
to leave the police jurisdiction in which he resides, shall notify
his intention to the police of the place, with a statement of the
extent of his journey. The police shall make inquiry how far
the applicant is in possession of the necessary means to arrive
at the place indicated, and how far he is assured either of work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
or of subsistence, or, in the contrary case, whether he is
provided with the means of modest subsistence for eight days
after his arrival. If the applicant cannot guarantee the aforesaid,
he can be sent or removed out of the country. Should no
ground be found for his removal, notification of his announcement
shall be certified in his book, and also leave for his
journey, granted by the Chief of Police in accordance with the
indicated wishes of the applicant; and further, a general sketch
of the route by which the journey shall be made, and of the
time in which it is to be accomplished, which arrangements
must not be altered without sufficient ground, except by leave
of the police.</p>

<p>6. On arrival at destination, as also when the individual
concerned, during his journey, passes the night at any market
town, or in Frederiksborg, Frederiksværk, Sikheborg, Nörresundby,
and Lögstör, or remains in any country place for more
than twenty-four hours, the residence-book must be exhibited to
the police, who shall certify such exhibition in the book itself.</p>

<p>7. The holder of the book, when he has not found work or
subsistence for eight days after he last notified the police, is
bound to notify himself anew to the police of the place in
which he happens to be, and can then, if not in possession of
the means of modest subsistence for eight days, be expelled
or sent out of the country.</p>

<p>He who has had no work for six weeks shall in all cases be
sent or removed from the country, unless he can prove how
during that period he has supported himself in a lawful
manner.</p>

<p>8. Every one who engages a foreigner to work must see that
the latter is provided with a residence-book. When the
foreigner quits his employment he (the employer) must certify
in the book how long the employment has lasted. In case of
his refusal, the holder of the book shall at once notify the
police, who shall insert in the book the necessary certificate.</p>

<p>Any conviction for offence must be certified in the book.
The individual concerned can apply for a new book without
such certificate if during the last five years he has not been
convicted of any offence.</p>

<p>9. In all cases treated in Articles 5 to 8 the party concerned,
should he at the period at which the notification should be made,
not find himself in the parish or market town where the Chief
of Police resides, may address himself to the local constable.
The latter shall, in the stead of the Chief, pursue the necessary
inquiry, and should the book be found in order, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
applicant fulfil the further conditions for continued residence
in the country, he (the constable) shall insert the necessary
certificate in the book; in the contrary case, he must refer the
applicant to the Chief of Police, to whom the book must at
once be remitted. Should the certificates which the said
functionary notifies require an injunction in a formal Protocol,
the costs are to be charged to the police account.</p>

<p>In coast districts, so far as the present Law is concerned, the
district Commissioners shall act in place of the Constables.</p>

<p>10. The dispositions of Articles 5 to 9 do not apply where
the parties have continuous service, or only leave one employment
to enter at once upon another. As long as such is the case
the residence-book serves as a mark-book, and the conditions to
be observed remain valid during the service.</p>

<p>The notice of servants' arrival and departure, which, by the
Law of the 10th May, 1854, paragraph 60, were to be made to
the parish priest, shall for the future be made to the constable,
who shall certify in the book the notices given, and report the
same in the Protocol as above.</p>

<p>11. Should the book be lost, notice must at once be given to
the police. Should nothing appear, either from the information
given by the owner or from any other source, of a nature to
excite suspicion that the book has been purposely made away
with, a new one shall be supplied, in which shall be recorded
such information as to his previous residence in the country as
can be procured without prolonged inquiry. In the contrary
event, the party shall at once be sent out of or removed from
the country, with such injunctions as are required by Articles 1
and 2.</p>

<p>12. The obligation to be provided with a residence-book
exists also where the party gains his livelihood in this country,
and he, moreover, is regarded as a native-born subject for the
purposes of this Law. The party concerned can claim a book
furnished with a certificate of his observance of this obligation.</p>

<p>13. He who has no rights as a native-born subject, and has
not any claim to maintenance in this country, can, if he has not
had continuous residence in this country for two years, be sent
or removed out of it, by order of the Minister of Justice, when
his conduct gives occasion therefor.</p>

<p>In the case of removal or expulsion, in respect of which the
Minister of Justice can designate the modifications prescribed
in Article 16, which, in the circumstances, may be found
suitable, such injunction can be given by order of the Minister
as is set forth in Article 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>14. When, under the provisions of this Law, residence is
refused to any one, the said person is to remain under the
observation and surveillance of the police until sent out of the
country.</p>

<p>15. All certificates mentioned in the preceding paragraphs
shall be given gratuitously, except those for leaving a commune
mentioned in Article 10, second portion, which shall be taxed
at 25 ore each. For the payment of the certifying of journey-books
is granted a sum in compensation out of the Treasury
chest, calculated on the average of the receipts on this account
during the last five years.</p>

<p>16. In all cases named in this Law removal from the country
shall be effected under police direction, and in the cheapest
manner compatible with the circumstances, by railway, waggon,
by sea, or on foot, so that hired conveyance is only used in rare
exceptions.</p>

<p>Removal shall be effected without escort by a compulsory pass
from the Chief of Police, so that the party, by means of conveyance
as aforesaid, and as far as possible under control, shall
be sent direct out of the country. The pass shall contain the
necessary details of the route, the police authorities to whom
the bearer shall present himself, as well as the amount given for
subsistence money. Only when the means of conveyance
aforesaid fail can the party be permitted to depart, and the
Chief of Police shall appoint in the pass a period in which the
journey must be completed; but such freedom of travel shall
not be conceded to persons who have been convicted of
vagrancy or mendicancy.</p>

<p>When a person is sent by one authority to another by such a
pass, the documents of identity are to be sent after him; and if
he departs by rail or by sea, due notice of his coming must be
given by telegraph to the police at the place of his destination.</p>

<p>In the event of any such removals, care must be taken that
the party is provided with the necessary clothing; that he is
not suffering from itch or any other contagious disease, and also
that his state of health is not such as to prevent the removal
being carried out.</p>

<p>17. The expenses incurred in removals in virtue of this Law,
as also the expenses of maintenance and lodging until departure,
and of clothing and watching in cases provided by Article 13,
are to be paid out of the Treasury chest, and the expenses of
those falling under Article 1, who are not permitted to reside in
the country, are to be paid by themselves so far as they have
the means. In all other cases, the expenses, including subsistence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
money, are to be paid by the communal funds of the
locality, according to the specially given injunctions, but may
be advanced by the police chest of any place. The Chief of
Police from whose jurisdiction any one is removed as aforesaid,
must take care that any expenses incurred thereby in another
jurisdiction, are immediately settled.</p>

<p>18. The right conceded to itinerant workmen to seek for
the ordinary assistance given by Guilds and Corporations is
abolished.</p>

<p>19. He who, for payment, lets out to any one lodgings either
by the day or by the week, or who gratuitously houses unknown
or vagrant personages, is bound to inquire of such information
as to their name, position, and last place of sojourn. The
statements received must, in Copenhagen and in all market
towns, including Frederiksborg, Frederiksværk, Sikheborg,
Nörresundby, and Lögstör, be communicated before noon on
the morrow in writing to the police, and elsewhere within
twenty-four hours to the constable, and in coast districts to the
Commissary, accompanied according to circumstances with
observations as to any ground which may appear for doubting
the accuracy of the statements made.</p>

<p>The police can require all keepers of hotels, inns, and
lodging-houses, and the waiters therein, instead of giving daily
notice as above, to keep a book authorized by the police,
which shall at any time be open to the inspection of the latter.
With regard to such persons who, under Article 6, are obliged
to announce themselves to the police, it is incumbent on all
who shelter them to see that such announcements are duly
made.</p>

<p>20. Every one is bound, when required by the police either
on account of information given in virtue of the preceding
paragraph or of other special circumstances, to prove further
that he is the person whom he professes to be, or to adduce such
information as to make this probable.</p>

<p>21. Every town and parish Council must see that twice a year
lists are compiled by which every house proprietor shall show
within eight days, exactly for every house the number of persons
resident therein, as well as their names, occupation, age, and
the date of their taking up residence in the commune. For
residents in Copenhagen the Regulations in force hitherto
remain valid.</p>

<p>22. Violations of the prescriptions of Articles 2, 11, and 13,
are to be punished with imprisonment on bread and water for 6
× 5 [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</i>] days, or hard labour for 180 days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Whoever, by false representations to the police, contrives that
the residence-book furnished to him does not answer to his real
name, or who wilfully tears out leaves therefrom, or makes use
of documents of identity not his own, or who lends those given
for his own use to another, or who deliberately makes false
statements under Articles 19, 20, and 21, shall be punished, if
no heavier sentence is provided by the law, with confinement on
bread and water for 2 × 5 [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</i>] days, or with simple imprisonment
for two months, or hard labour for sixty days, or under
extenuating circumstances, with a fine of from 5 to 100 crowns.</p>

<p>Deviations from the route prescribed in a police pass, or
neglect to accomplish the journey in the prescribed time, unless
reasonable excuse can be alleged, are to be punished with
imprisonment, of not more than five days on bread and water.
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</i> Penal Law, section 25.)</p>

<p>Other violations of this Law to be punished with fines of
from 2 to 50 crowns.</p>

<p>Prosecutions under this Law to be brought by the Public
Prosecutor.</p>

<p>So soon as any sentence of fine imposed by this Law is read
or communicated to the offender, shall the fine, when the
sentence is undisputed, or the offender declares himself satisfied
therewith, be at once exacted, paid, and in default of payment,
without any appeal to the authorities, forthwith expiated in
accordance with the prescriptions of the Law of the 16th
February, 1866, upon the expiation of fines.</p>

<p>23. Certain Laws repugnant to the provisions of this Law are
repealed.</p>

<p>24. This Law, which has no operation in the Faro Isles, shall
come into force on the 1st July, 1875.</p>

<p>Dated at the Amelienborg, the 15th May, 1875.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_E" id="APPENDIX_E">APPENDIX E.</a>
<br />SUMMARY OF THE THREE PRINCIPAL ACTS
<br />OF THE UNITED STATES.</h2>


<h3>I.&mdash;THE "ACT TO REGULATE IMMIGRATION," 1882.</h3>

<p>Section 1 provides for the levying of a duty of fifty cents on
all alien passengers arriving at any port in the United States.
The money thus collected goes to form the "Immigrant Fund,"
which is used for the purpose of defraying the expenses of
carrying out the Act, and for the care of the immigrants who
arrive at the ports in sickness or distress.</p>

<p>By Section 2 the Secretary of the Treasury is charged with the
general supervision of immigration business. He is empowered
to enter into contracts with such State Commissioners or Boards
as may be designated by the Governor of any State, to take
charge of the Local immigration of the ports within the said
States. It authorizes the State Commissioners to appoint persons
to go on board the ships when they arrive at the ports, and if
"on such examination there shall be found among such passengers
any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take
care of himself or herself, without becoming a public charge,
they shall report the same in writing to the collector of such
port, and such persons shall not be permitted to land."</p>

<p>Section 3 gives the Secretary of the Treasury wide discretion
as to the regulations which he may deem fit to issue from time
to time.</p>

<p>Section 4 enacts that "all foreign convicts, except those convicted
of political offences, upon arrival shall be sent back to
the nations to which they belong." Lastly&mdash;and this is most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
important&mdash;"the expense of the return of such passengers as
are not permitted to land shall be borne by the owners of the
vessel in which they came."</p>


<h3>II.&mdash;THE ALIEN CONTRACT LABOUR LAW, 1885.</h3>

<p>By Section 1 it is made unlawful for any person, company, etc.,
to prepay the transportation, or in any way assist the importation,
of aliens under contract to perform labour made previous
to the importation.</p>

<p>Section 2 declares that all such contracts shall be void in the
United States.</p>

<p>Section 3 imposes a penalty of one thousand dollars for each
violation of Section 1.</p>

<p>Section 4 declares that any master of a vessel knowingly
bringing any such labourers into the United States, is guilty of
a misdemeanour, and will be fined five hundred dollars for each
labourer, or six months' imprisonment, or both.</p>

<p>Section 5 makes certain exceptions to the excluded classes, in
the case of a skilled workman engaged to carry out a new industry
not already established in the United States, and so
forth.</p>

<p>In 1885 further sections were added to this Act, providing for
the examination of ships; for the non-landing of prohibited
persons; for the return of such persons by Boards designated
by the Secretary of the Treasury; and for compelling the expense
of the return of such persons to be borne by the owners of the
vessels which brought them to America; the owners and
masters of vessels refusing to pay such expenses, not being
allowed to land at, or clear from, any port in the United States.</p>


<h3>III.&mdash;THE IMMIGRATION ACT OF 1891.</h3>

<p>The new Act may briefly be analyzed as follows:&mdash;Section 1
specifies the classes of aliens henceforth to be excluded from
admission to the United States, viz.&mdash;All idiots, insane persons,
paupers, or persons likely to become a public charge; persons
suffering from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease;
persons who have been convicted of felony or other infamous
crime or misdemeanour involving moral turpitude; polygamists;
and also any persons whose ticket or passage is paid for with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the money of another, or who is assisted by others to come,
unless it is satisfactorily shown on inquiry that such person
does not belong to any of the foregoing excluded classes, or to
the class of contract labourers excluded by the Act of 1885. As
in the Act of 1882, the exclusion of persons convicted of political
offences is carefully guarded against.</p>

<p>Section 2 provides for the more vigorous enforcement of the
Act of 1885.</p>

<p>Sections 3 and 4 declare that immigrants coming to the United
States through the solicitation of advertising agents in Europe
shall be treated as violators of the law, and steamship companies
are prohibited from encouraging such immigration.</p>

<p>Section 5 specifies ministers of religion, persons belonging to
the recognized professions, and professors of colleges or seminaries,
as persons not to be excluded under the Act of 1885.</p>

<p>Section 6 provides penalties of fine and imprisonment up to
a thousand dollars, or a year's imprisonment, or both, for violation
of Act.</p>

<p>Section 7 establishes the office of Superintendent of Immigration
under the Treasury Department. The remaining sections
of the Act may be summarized as follows:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) That the names
and nationalities of immigrants shall be reported on arrival, and
that they shall be promptly inspected by authorized agents
empowered to decide upon their right to land. (<i>b</i>) Provision is
made for the better inspection of the Canadian, British, Columbian,
and Mexican borders, (<i>c</i>) That State and municipal
authorities may exercise such jurisdiction over immigrant stations
as may be necessary for the public peace, (<i>d</i>) That all immigrants
who come in violation of the law shall be immediately
sent back to the ships that brought them to the port; or if that
be impracticable, they may be returned at any time within a
year after their arrival. Any alien who may become a public
charge within a year from his arrival shall be sent back to the
country from whence he came. (<i>e</i>) That the Federal Courts
shall have full jurisdiction in all cases arising under this Act.</p>

<br />STATUTES PASSED BY THE COLONIES TO
<br />RESTRICT PAUPER IMMIGRATION.</h2>

<h3>CANADA.</h3>


<p>The Immigration Act, 1886 (R.S.C. 1886, c. 65,
secs. 23 and 24) enacts as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The landing
of pauper immigrants
may be prohibited.</div>

<p>Sec. 23. The Governor-General may by proclamation,
whenever he deems it necessary, prohibit the
landing of pauper or destitute immigrants in all ports
or any port in Canada, until such sums of money as
are found necessary are provided and paid into the
hands of one of the Canadian immigration agents, by
the master of the vessel carrying such immigrants,
for their temporary support and transport to their
place of destination; and during such time as any
such pauper immigrants would, in consequence of
such orders, have to remain on board such vessel,
the Governor in Council may provide for proper
anchorage grounds being assigned to such vessel, and
for such vessel being visited and superintended by
the medical superintendent or any inspecting physician
of the port or quarantine station, and for the
necessary measures being taken to prevent the rise
or spread of diseases amongst the passengers in such
vessel and amongst people on shore.&mdash;32 and 33 Vict.
c. 10, s. 16.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Landing of
vicious immigrants
may
be prohibited.</div>

<p>Sec. 24. The Governor-General may, by proclamation,
whenever he deems it necessary, prohibit the
landing in Canada of any criminal, or other vicious
class of immigrants designated in such proclamation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
except upon such conditions for insuring their re-transportation
to the port in Europe whence they
came with the least possible delay, as the Governor
in Council prescribes; and such conditions may, if
the Governor in Council deems it necessary, include
the immediate return, or the return with the least
possible delay, of the vessel and such immigrants to
the said port&mdash;such prohibited immigrants remaining
on board until such return of the vessel.&mdash;35 Vict. c.
28, s. 10.</p>


<h3>VICTORIA.</h3>

<p>The Passengers, Harbours, and Navigation Statute,
1865 (No. 255), enacts as follows in secs. 36-39:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bond to be
given for
passengers
being lunatic,
etc.</div>

<p>36. If the immigration officer, or assistant immigration
officer, shall certify that any passenger shall
have arrived in Victoria on board any ship as aforesaid
(<i>i.e.</i> any British or foreign navigable vessel of
any kind carrying passengers, except vessels plying
from any one port in Victoria to any other port therein)
being either lunatic, idiotic, deaf, dumb, blind, or
infirm, and likely, in his opinion, to become a charge
upon the public, or upon any public or charitable institution,
the immigration officer shall require the
owner, charterer, or master of such ship, within seven
days after her arrival to execute with two sufficient
sureties, jointly and severally, a bond to her Majesty
in the sum of 100<i>l.</i> for every such passenger, conditioned
to pay to the Treasurer of Victoria all moneys
or expenses which shall or may be laid out or incurred
within the space of five years from the execution
of the said bond for the maintenance or support
of such passenger; and the said sureties shall justify
before and to the satisfaction of the said immigration
officer, and shall by their oath or affirmation satisfy
him that they are respectively residents in Victoria,
and each worth treble the amount of the penalty of
such bond over and above all their liabilities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Principal
immigration
agent to report
as to
forfeiture.</div>

<p>37. If any passenger for whom any bond shall have
been given as aforesaid, shall at any time within five
years from the execution thereof receive maintenance
or support from any public or charitable institution in
Victoria, the payment incurred for the maintenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and support of such passenger shall be provided for
out of the money collected in and under such bond to
the extent of the penalty therein mentioned, or such
portion as shall be required for the payment of such
maintenance or support; and it shall be the duty of
the principal immigration agent, upon representation
made to him, to ascertain the right and claim of the
Treasurer of Victoria to payment of the amount so
expended for the maintenance and support of any
such passenger, and to report the same to the Governor
in Council; and the said report shall be conclusive in
the matter, and shall be evidence of the facts therein
stated; and such bond may be put in suit, and the
penalty, or as much thereof as shall be required to
defray the expenses of such maintenance or support,
may be recovered by suit or information on behalf of
her Majesty, and in the name of a law officer in any

<h3>SOUTH AUSTRALIA.</h3>

<p>Sec. 15 of the Immigration Act, 1872, enacts as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Governor in Council may from time to time
frame, annul, alter, and vary such regulations as may
be necessary for declaring what persons shall be
eligible for immigration to the said Province (<i>i.e.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
South Australia), and generally for carrying out the
provisions of this Act; and all such regulations, and
all instructions which may from time to time be transmitted
to any immigration agent, shall be forthwith
published in the <i>South Australian Government Gazette</i>
for general information, and shall be, within one
week from their publication, if Parliament be then
sitting, or, if not, then within one week from the next
meeting of Parliament, laid upon the table of each
House of Parliament.</p>

<p>The above Act was passed to "encourage and assist
immigration into South Australia, and to provide for
the control and supervision of such immigration."
Pauper emigrants would not, in all probability, be
allowed to land.</p>


<h3>TASMANIA.</h3>

<p>The Passengers Act, 1885, enacts as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bond to be
given for
certain
passengers.</div>

<p>Sec. 3. If the collector (at the port of arrival) shall
certify that any passenger shall have arrived in Tasmania
on board any ship (except one plying from any
one port in the Colony to any other port therein)
being either lunatic, idiotic, deaf, dumb, blind, or
infirm, or from any cause unable to support himself,
or likely, in the opinion of the collector, to become
a charge upon the public, or upon any public or
charitable institution, the collector shall require the
owner, charterer, or master of such ship, within seven
days after her arrival, to execute a bond to her
Majesty in the sum of 100<i>l.</i> for every such passenger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditions
of the bond.</div>

<p>4. Every such bond shall be entered into with at
least two sufficient sureties, and the person giving
such bond and his sureties shall be bound jointly and
severally to pay to the Treasurer of Tasmania all
moneys and expenses which shall be laid out or incurred
within the space of five years from the execution
of the said bond for the maintenance or support
of such passenger; and the said sureties shall justify
before and to the satisfaction of the collector, and
shall by their oath or affirmation satisfy him, that
they are respectively residents in Tasmania, and each
worth treble the amount of the penalty of such bond
over and above all their liabilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Provisions as
to ships
quarantined.</div>

<p>5. Whenever any such ship or the passengers by
such ship shall have performed quarantine in accordance
with any law for the time being in force, then
the period within which the owner, charterer, or master
shall be required to give such bond shall be within
seven days after such ship or passenger has or have
performed quarantine and been duly discharged therefrom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bond to be
applied to
maintenance.</div>

<p>6. If any passenger for whom any bond shall have
been given as aforesaid, shall at any time within five
years from the execution thereof receive maintenance
or support from any public or charitable institution
in Tasmania, the amount expended for the maintenance
and support of such passenger shall be provided
for and repaid as herein-after provided out of the
moneys collected under such bond, to the extent of
the penalty therein mentioned, or such portion thereof
as shall be required for the payment of such maintenance
or support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Authority in
charge of institution
to
report as to
forfeiture of
bond.</div>

<p>7. It shall be the duty of the authority or person
having the control or charge of such public or charitable
institution, to ascertain the right and claim of the
Treasurer of Tasmania to payment of the amount so
expended for the maintenance and support of any
such passenger, and to report the same to him with
all such information as may enable the Treasurer to
recover the moneys due.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bond may be
put in suit.</div>

<p>8. Every such report shall be conclusive in the
matter, and shall be evidence of the facts therein
stated; and every such bond may be put in suit, and
the penalty, or as much thereof as shall be required
to defray the expenses of such maintenance or support,
may be recovered by suit or information on behalf of
her Majesty, and in the name of a law officer in any
court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Penalty for
refusing to
execute
bond.</div>

<p>9. If the owner, charterer, or master of any ship
shall neglect or refuse to execute a bond in any case
within the provisions of this Act within seven days
after being so required as aforesaid, he shall be liable
to a penalty not exceeding 100<i>l.</i>, and the payment of
such penalty shall not be deemed to exonerate such
owner, charterer, or master from being compelled to
execute such bond as by this Act provided; and such
ship shall not either during or after the expiration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the said period of seven days be cleared out unless
and until the said bond shall have been executed and
the said penalty has been paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Act not to
extend to
Government
immigrants,
etc.</div>

<p>10. The provisions of this Act shall not extend to
immigrants brought to Tasmania either wholly or
partly at the expense of the Colony, nor to shipwrecked
mariners brought to Tasmania without charge by the
master of some other ship than that in which they
were wrecked, nor to her Majesty's land and sea
forces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recovery of
penalties.</div>

<p>11. All penalties incurred under section 9 shall be
recovered in a summary way before any two or more
Justices of the Peace in the mode prescribed by the
Magistrates' Summary Procedure Act (19 Vict., No.
8); and any person who thinks himself aggrieved by
the imposition of any such penalty, may appeal against
the same in the mode prescribed by the Appeals
Regulation Act (19 Vict., No. 10).</p>


<h3>NEW ZEALAND.</h3>

<p>The Imbecile Passengers Act, 1882 (No. 58), is the
same as the Tasmania Act above cited, and need not,
therefore, be set out in detail. The only differences
are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="ia">(1.) The word "New Zealand" must be read
throughout instead of "Tasmania."</p>

<p class="ia">(2.) In secs. 3 and 5, "fourteen days" must be read
for "seven days."</p>

<p class="ia">(3.) In sec. 4, after the words "maintenance or
support of such passenger," the words "by
or in any public or charitable institution in
New Zealand" must be inserted.</p>

<p class="ia">(4.) In sec. 8, instead of the words from "defray"
to the end, the following must be read:
"defray the charges incurred in such maintenance
or support, may be recovered on
behalf of her Majesty in the manner provided
by the Crown Suits Act, 1881."</p>

<p class="ia">(5.) The following must be added as sec. 9:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ia2">All moneys recovered or received under
any such bond as aforesaid shall be paid by
the Commissioner to the public or charitable
institution, by or in which any such passenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
may have been maintained or supported as
aforesaid.</p>

<p class="ia">(6.) Instead of sec. 11 read as sec. 12:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ia2">All penalties incurred under sec. 10 (sec.
9 of the Tasmanian Act) shall be recoverable
in a summary way before any two or more
Justices of the Peace.</p></blockquote>
